This generalization can obscure the nuances of the original statement and potentially overemphasize the universality of the issue being addressed. The shift from 'they have managed' to 'problems... have been minimized' also changes the agency; the original implies active management (potentially by local actors or organizations), while the translation suggests a more passive outcome, potentially downplaying local agency and initiatives within those regions. This could reinforce a Western-centric view where solutions are often assumed to originate from or be overseen by external entities rather than local ones.

This again could shift the focus away from the actors in the region who addressed the problem.

**Explanation:**

This sentence seems to be a commentary on the way technology and social media can be overwhelming and potentially harmful, especially for those who are already struggling. 

* **""‰∏çÂ≠òÂú®‚ÄúËã¶ÈöæÁöÑ‰∫∫ÊãíÁªù‚Äù""** translates to ""There is no 'suffering people refuse'"". This part is likely referring to a hypothetical idea or argument that people experiencing hardship would reject certain things, like the increasing brightness of screens.

In many cultures, the term 'elected official' carries more weight and legitimacy than 'state employee,' implying a direct mandate from the people.

The Estonian sentence ""Aga kui pole m√µlemat koos, ei juhtu midagi eriti suurt"" consists of several parts.

* ""Aga"" is a conjunction that can be translated as ""but"" or ""however.""

* ""pole"" is a verb that means ""is not.""
* ""m√µlemat"" is a pronoun that means ""both"" or ""all.""

The Finnish sentence ""Valtio omistaa Finnairista yli puolet"" consists of two main parts: ""Valtio omistaa"" (The state owns) and ""Finnairista yli puolet"" (more than half of Finnair). The word ""omistaa"" means ""to own"" and ""puolet"" means ""half"". The word ""yli"" means ""over"" or ""more than"".

""Sergilenen bu uzla≈üƒ± g√∂r√ºnt√ºs√ºne"" means ""the displayed reconciliation image.""

""Raƒümen"" means ""despite"" or ""in the face of.""
