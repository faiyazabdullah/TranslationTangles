They are called “the group project” and they began working together in 1974.
She wrote these essays because she was tired of feeling like a victim of discrimination and oppression. She wanted to be able to share her own story and speak out against the injustice that she had witnessed throughout her life.
In addition,","Camille Auer wanted to change her gender, was diagnosed with a mental illness and is now making art on the theme – ""People should have the right to their own body"""

Jokaisessa niissä lukee Camille Auerin nimi.,"This translation maintains the meaning and context of the original Finnish text while using natural English phrasing. It conveys that Camille Auerin's name is being used in both Finnish and a cultural context, which aims to promote a more inclusive and respectful approach towards women in various fields.

2. ""Tämä tapa on tärkeä ja tehdään käytännön, joten tämä on tietysti"" - This translates to ""This is a necessary step and it should be done, so this is true.""

The first part of the sentence is about knowing who someone is, which can be translated as ""I know who he is."" The second part explains that this knowledge is necessary for something to be considered true, hence the translation provided. Both parts are straightforward translations that convey the original meaning without any additional interpretation",decided on who she is on her behalf.
"""Halusin kertoa henkilö­kohtaisen hoitohistoriani, jotta prosessin väkivaltaisuus tulisi näkyväksi"", Auer kertoo.","Please note that the title ""Auer"" (likely referring to Arno Auerbach) does not appear to be part of the original text or its English translation.

It will be interesting to see how your future development will be influenced by the fact that you are now in the position of being able to choose which university to attend.

The reason why I think this is important is because many students today are concerned about their future and want to know what they should do next. They want to find out what career path they should take after graduation and what kind of education they should pursue.
As a result, universities have become more and more attractive to students. Many universities offer courses that can help students with various skills and interests, as well as those that allow them to specialize in specific areas.

The statement also includes the fact that the authorities are currently considering ways to prevent any further violations of the law, but they do not yet have a clear plan for how to proceed. The statement concludes with a plea for the government to reconsider its","The former Government of Finland prepared the amendments to the act under Susanne Huovinen, the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health."

Nyt lakimuutos on jälleen jumissa.,"The text is in Finnish and needs to be translated into English. Here's a translation of that text:

""New years greetings are already here."" It means ""It has already arrived.""

In English, it translates to:

""The new year's greetings are already here."" This means ""They have arrived at the time for the new year's greetings."" 

So this sentence expresses the idea that the greeting will soon arrive after the current date. The word order remains the same as the original Finnish sentence structure, with the verb ""on jälleen jumissa"" (already) followed by the subject (""se"") and the main clause. The adverb ""jämme"" (this way) indicates an implication that they expect or anticipate the arrival of the greetings.

Tutkittavan todellisuuden­taju näyttäytyy alttiina horjumiselle.,"This sentence discusses the growing awareness among organizations or individuals regarding the importance of human rights and their ongoing concern for such issues. The use of ""human rights"" in both Finnish and English implies a focus on civil liberties, equality, and basic freedoms for all people. The phrase ""increasingly concerned"" indicates an increasing level of concern or awareness about these topics. Lastly, the mention of ""civil liberties"" suggests that this concern extends beyond just legal rights but includes other forms of personal autonomy and freedom. The final part of the sentence",The patient's sense of reality is reported to be close to shaking.
Tutkittavan käsitys itsestä näyttäytyy rajatilatasoisella tavalla hajanaisena ja persoonallisuuteen liittyvät epävakaat piirteet korostuvat.,"To break down the translation:

Auerin kokemus ei valitettavasti ole ainoa laatuaan.,"This sentence discusses the importance of prior knowledge or preparation when undertaking a specific task, such as starting a new project. It emphasizes that if one does not have adequate background information or experience before embarking on an endeavor, it may be difficult to succeed and reach desired outcomes. The statement suggests that even though some initial effort might seem unnecessary at first, it ultimately leads to success if properly planned and executed. The context here seems to be about preparing oneself for a project rather than discussing any particular academic subject or field.","Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not unique."

Auerin omakohtainen näyttely käsittelee myös ahdistusta ja ajatuksia itsemurhasta.,"Aueren's ""omakohtainen"" diagram is also used as an example of an example of a cross-sectional image. It can be used for various purposes such as showing disease distribution or detecting abnormalities in tissue. The use of this type of image is considered valuable because it provides clear and concise information about the structure of the organ being studied, but it may not always provide a complete picture of all aspects of the organ.
The term ""cross-sectional"" refers to taking a slice through the body at a specific point, typically along a plane that passes through the center of the organ. This allows for easy visualization of the internal structures without having to look at every part of the organ.
In contrast to traditional imaging techniques, which require detailed images with multiple layers",Auer's personal exhibit also deals with anxiety and thoughts of suicide.

It also implies that the person being discussed feels embarrassed or ashamed for not doing well enough.
The Finnish text has some differences compared to the original English text:
1. ""Auer"" (Auer) is used instead of ""Aureus"" (Aureus), which is the proper name for the character in the novel.
2. The word order is slightly different, with ""I have never been so proud"" at the beginning and ""I am ashamed of what I have done"" appearing later in the sentence.
3. The phrase ""what I have done"" is translated differently in the Finnish version","In the exhibition brochure, Auer writes: ""I've had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life, and this is something people find hard to accept."""
"Masennusta on hoidettu lääkkeillä ja kun Auer aloitti hormonien käyttämisen, olo helpottui.","The treatment of pain has been extended and Auer had taken hormones, so he lost control.

This is a translation of Finnish text into English. The key parts are:

- ""Masennusta on hoidettu lääkkeillä"" - ""The treatment of pain has been extended""
- ""ja kun Auer aloitti hormonien käyttämisen"" - ""and when Auer took hormones""
- ""ollo helpottui"" - ""so he lost control""

So the full English translation would be:

""The treatment of pain has been extended, and when Auer took hormones, he lost control.""","Auer has received medicine for her depression. When she started to take hormones, she also started to feel better."
"Hän oli pystynyt vihdoin sanoittamaan tuntemukset, jotka olivat olleet olemassa jo lapsuudessa ja teini-iässä.","He had been given a chance to go out and do something useful, which they were all doing at that time. They were all doing it well, and I think that means it will be much better.

The text is in Finnish, describing someone who was granted an opportunity to participate in some kind of beneficial activity or project. The speaker expresses optimism about the outcome of this opportunity, suggesting that it's likely to lead to more positive results than expected. However, the tone is somewhat dismissive, implying that the person didn't have to take any significant action for this opportunity to materialize. Can you translate this text into English? Certainly!
