Mis on ühist Barbara Corcoranil ja Laila Alil?,What do Barbara Corcoran and Laila Ali have in common?,What do Barbara Corcoran and Laila Ali have in common?
Esmapilgul on need naised pärit kahest täiesti erinevast maailmast.,"At first glance, these women come from two completely different worlds.","On paper, the women are from two very different worlds."
"New Yorgi kinnisvaramagnaat Barbara Corcoran suutis teisendada tuhande dollari suuruse laenu viie miljardi vääriliseks kinnisvaraettevõtteks, enne kui rakendas oma asjatundlikkust teleekraanil, osaledes ABC tõsielusarja ""Shark Tank"" investorite paneelis.","New York real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran managed to transform a $1,000 loan into a $5 billion worth real estate company, before applying her expertise on the television screen, participating in the investor panel of the ABC reality series ""Shark Tank"".","New York real-estate tycoon, Barbara Corcoran, turned a $1,000 loan into a $5 billion real estate business, before taking her expertise to the small screen, serving on the panel of investors on ABC's Shark Tank."
"Laila Ali on käinud oma isa jälgedes, saades neljakordse võitmatu tšempionina kõige edukamaks naispoksijaks, enne kui tema resümeesse lisandusid veel telesaatejuhi, autori ja kõneleja rollid.","Laila Ali has followed in her father's footsteps, becoming the most successful female boxer of all time as an undefeated four-time champion, before adding television host, author, and speaker to her resume.","Laila Ali followed in her father's footsteps, becoming the most successful female in women's boxing as a four-time undefeated champion before adding TV host, author and speaker to her resume."
"Vaatamata nende unikaalsetele karjääriteekondadele (või ehk hoopis nende tõttu) värbas TJ Maxx ometi mõlemad naised, et nad aitaksid rääkida saalitäiele lootusrikastele ettevõtjatele stereotüüpide murdmisest ja kõrgelennuliste eesmärkide saavutamisest.","Despite their unique career paths (or perhaps because of them), TJ Maxx recruited both women to help tell the story to hopeful entrepreneurs in the audience about breaking stereotypes and achieving high-flying goals.","Yet despite (or perhaps because of) their unique career paths, TJ Maxx enlisted the help of both women to talk breaking stereotypes and accomplishing lofty goals to a ballroom full of hopeful entrepreneurs."
"Eelmisel aastal kõneles T.J. Maxx sadadele naistele poodides üle riigi ja avastas, et 80 protsenti neist tunneb, et ühiskond on seadnud neile stereotüüpselt kindlad rollid ja ootused.","Last year, T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in stores across the country and discovered that 80 percent of them feel that society has set stereotypical roles and expectations for them.","Last year, T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in stores across the country and discovered that 80 percent feel stereotyped by society into specific roles and expectations."
"Sellest tulenevalt tulid nad välja projektiga The Maxx You Project, et aidata naistel neid barjääre lõhkuda.","As a result, they came up with the project The Maxx You Project, to help women break down these barriers.",So they launched The Maxx You Project aimed at helping women break those barriers.
"Corcoron ja Ali teavad sellest nii mõndagi. Nad võivad küll olla praeguseks oma valdkonna tipus, aga teekond sinna ei olnud kummagi jaoks sujuv.","Corcoran and Ali know a thing or two about that. They may be at the top of their field now, but the journey there wasn't smooth for either of them.","Which Corcoron and Ali know a thing or two about: They may be at the top of their games now, but it wasn't a smooth road to success for either woman."
Corcoran sai keskkoolis ja kolledžis hindeks peamiselt D-sid ja oli töötanud 23-aastaseks saades juba 20 töökohal.,Corcoran received mostly D's in high school and college and had worked at 20 jobs by the time he was 23.,"Corcoran earned straight D's in high school and college, hopped between 20 jobs by the time she turned 23."
"Ali sisenes ühte kõige meestekesksemasse valdkonda ja lisaks seisis tema teel ees katsumus üritada astuda välja oma isa varjust, kes oli üleilme ikoon.","She entered one of the most male-dominated fields and on top of that, she faced the challenge of trying to step out of the shadow of her father, who was a global icon.",Ali entered one of the most male-dominated industries and had the added struggle of carving out her own place beyond the shadow of her global icon father.
Need kaks pehmelt öeldes pakatavad läbi raskuste omandatud teadmistest.,"These two, to put it mildly, pack the knowledge acquired through hardships.",To say the two are brimming with hard-learned advice is an understatement.
"Seetõttu istusime nende mõjukate naistega maha, et rääkida ebaõnnestumiste ületamisest, eduga toimetulekust ning oma kõhutunde usaldamisest äris ja suhetes.","We sat down with these influential women to talk about overcoming failures, dealing with success, and trusting your gut in business and relationships.","So we sat down with the two powerhouses to talk overcoming failure, navigating success and trusting their gut instincts in business and relationships."

"Kui ma mõnel päeval ei tunne sedamoodi, siis lihtsalt teesklen neid tundeid.","If I don't feel that way on some days, then I simply pretend to have those feelings.","When I don't feel that way on certain days, I pretend I feel that way."
Siis jään iseenda häma uskuma ja saangi jälle inspiratsiooni.,Then I'll start believing in myself again and get inspiration.,Then I start falling for my own baloney and I get inspired again.

"Laila Ali: Ma ütleks, et minu karjääris oli kõige raskem aeg siis, kui ma tegelesin poksimisega, olin oma karjääri tipus ja otsustasin lahutuse sisse anda.","Laila Ali: I would say that the toughest time in my career was when I was boxing, I was at the peak of my career and I decided to get a divorce.","Laila Ali: I would say one of the toughest times I've had in my career was when I was in boxing, I was at the height of my career and decided I was going to get a divorce."

"Ma ei uskunud, et suudan ilma temata hakkama saada.",I didn't think I could manage without him/her.,I didn't think that I could do it without him.
"Seega hakkasin muretsema oma karjääri tuleviku pärast ja pidin leidma aja, et astuda sammuke tagasi ja öelda endale: ""Sul on kõik vajalikud teadmised ja kogemused.","So I started worrying about the future of my career and had to find time to take a step back and tell myself: ""You have all the necessary knowledge and experience.""","So I became concerned about the future of my career and had to take the time to step back and say, ""Hey, you have all the knowledge and expertise."
