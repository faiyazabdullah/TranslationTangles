A few months ago, I had my first experience with this and was surprised by how much it helped me.
The hardest thing for an English speaker to do is to get past their fear of speaking in public. Many people are afraid to speak because they don’t know what to say or where to start. However, once you have practiced enough, your comfort level will increase and you’ll find that talking to strangers doesn’t seem so scary anymore.
This can be a very useful skill to have if you’re planning on going to China anytime soon. It’s also great for those who want to communicate with Chinese speakers without being able to read the language themselves.
A good way to practice is through conversations with native speakers. If you don’t have access to someone fluent in Mandarin, then you could try using a conversation app like HelloTalk or Tandem. These apps allow you to connect with other users around the world who can help you improve your fluency in Mandarin.
Another option is to take online courses offered by platforms such as Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone. These courses are designed specifically to teach",克服这一点最简单的办法就是学习一点普通话——这比人们可能想象的要简单。
