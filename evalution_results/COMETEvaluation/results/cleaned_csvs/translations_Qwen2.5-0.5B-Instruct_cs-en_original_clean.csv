„Dochází k porušování občanských práv.,"Both translations convey the same meaning and accurately capture the essence of the original Czech sentence. The phrase ""porušování občanských práv"" (transliteration: ""Porušování občanských práv"") means ""ensuring or protecting citizens' rights"" in English.

The word order has been slightly adjusted in both versions, but the core message remains consistent.","""You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people."

""Read online about our presentation and its significance as we understand that the most important thing is to have a website with us.""

The result was a significant choice. 

This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Czech text while maintaining its tone and context. It describes the event in detail and highlights the significance of the decision made by the authorities in dealing with the injured individual's condition. The use of ""výsledek"" (result) and ""vyběh"" (choice) helps convey the idea that this was an important decision taken by those involved. The word order has been adjusted slightly for","Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime."
