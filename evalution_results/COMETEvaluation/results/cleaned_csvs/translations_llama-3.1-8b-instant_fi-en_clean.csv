"Camille Auer halusi korjata sukupuolensa, diagnosoitiin mielisairaaksi ja nyt hän tekee taidetta aiheesta - ""Ihmisellä pitäisi olla oikeus omaan kehoonsa""","The translation of the Finnish text to English is:

Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, was diagnosed as mentally ill, and now she creates art about the subject - ""A person should have the right to their own body.""

Note: The translation is quite direct, but it's worth noting that the original text has a more nuanced and poetic tone, which might be lost in translation.","Camille Auer wanted to change her gender, was diagnosed with a mental illness and is now making art on the theme – ""People should have the right to their own body"""
Kuvataideakatemian Project room -gallerian katosta roikkuu kymmeniä potilaskertomuksia.,The Project room gallery at the Academy of Fine Arts has dozens of patient stories hanging from its ceiling.,Dozens of patient reports are hanging from the ceiling of the Project Room gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts.
Jokaisessa niissä lukee Camille Auerin nimi.,"In each of them, Camille Auer's name is written.",The name of Camille Auer is written on every one of them.
"Paperit kertovat monivuotisen tarinan siitä, kuinka ulkopuoliset ihmiset ovat kirjoittaneet ylös tulkintansa Auerista ja tämän identiteetistä.",The papers tell a multi-year story of how outsiders have written up their interpretations of Auer and his identity.,The reports tell a long story of what kind of an interpretation other people have written of Auer and her identity –
Päättäneet hänen puolestaan kuka hän on.,Decided for him who he is.,decided on who she is on her behalf.
"""Halusin kertoa henkilö­kohtaisen hoitohistoriani, jotta prosessin väkivaltaisuus tulisi näkyväksi"", Auer kertoo.","""I wanted to share my personal care history, so the violence in the process would become visible,"" Auer says.","""I wanted to disclose my personal medical history to highlight the violence of the whole process"", Auer says."
Prosessilla hän viittaa sukupuolenkorjausprosessiin.,"He refers to the sex reassignment process.

Note: 'Sukupuolenkorjausprosessi' is a Finnish term that roughly translates to 'sex reassignment process' or 'gender reassignment process'.","Here, ""process"" refers to her sex reassignment procedure."
"Se on usein vuosia kestävä tutkimusjakso johon kuuluu tapaamisia psykologien, psykiatrien, hoitajien ja lääkäreiden kanssa.","It is often a research period that lasts for years, which includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, and doctors.","It is a many-year examination period, including meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and physicians."
"Prosessi käynnistyy lähetteellä ""sukupuoli-identiteetin häiriön"" ­diagnosointitutkimuksiin, joita suoritetaan Tampereella ja Helsingissä.","The process starts with a referral to diagnostic examinations for ""gender identity disorder"", which are conducted in Tampere and Helsinki.",The process starts with a referral to diagnose a gender identity disorder. These diagnoses are performed in Tampere and Helsinki.
Auerin kohdalla prosessi käynnistyi neljä vuotta sitten.,The process started at Auerin four years ago.,Auer's process started four years ago.
Jo ennen tätä hän oli käyttänyt internetin kautta tilaamaansa estrogeeniä ja oli muutenkin hyvin pitkällä omassa korjausprosessissaan.,"Before this, he had already used the estrogen he had ordered over the internet and was otherwise quite far along in his own recovery process.","Before this, she had already been using oestrogen ordered from the internet and was also otherwise far in her own reassignment procedure."
"Hän koki olevansa nainen, mutta Suomen lain mukaan henkilön täytyy käydä läpi korjausprosessi, jotta sukupuoli voidaan korjata myös juridisesti.","He felt like a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through a correction process in order for their gender to be corrected also legally.","Even though she felt like a woman, Finnish legislation states that an individual must undergo a reassignment procedure before the gender can also be altered legally."
"Translaki, eli laki transsek­suaalin sukupuolen vahvistamisesta (563/2002) velvoittaa transsukupuoliset ihmiset pakkosterilisaatioon, jotta oikea sukupuoli saadaan esimerkiksi väestönrekisterikeskukseen ja passiin.","The Trans Act, or the Act on the Confirmation of Transsexual Status (563/2002), obliges transsexual individuals to undergo forced sterilization in order to obtain the correct sex, for example, in the population register centre and on their passport.

Note: The law mentioned here has been criticized and is no longer in effect. In 2023, Finland's parliament voted to repeal the law.","The Act on the Legal Recognition of the Gender of Transsexuals (563/2002), or the trans act, obligates transgender people to a compulsory sterilisation so that their correct gender can be registered, for example, in the Population Register Centre and their passport."
Tällä hetkellä jokaiselta sukupuoltaan korjaavalta vaaditaan psykiatrista diagnoosia ja todistusta lisääntymiskyvyttömyydestä.,"Currently, each gender-affirming individual is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and proof of infertility.

Note: The translation is quite literal and may not fully capture the nuances of the original text. The term ""sukupuoltaan korjaavalta"" can be translated to ""gender-affirming"" or ""transgender"", but it's worth noting that the Finnish term is more specific and implies a person who is undergoing or has undergone gender-affirming treatment.","Currently, each person about to change their gender is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of their inability to reproduce."
Ihmiselle kuuluu oikeus päättää omasta kehostaan.,"The translation of the Finnish text to English is:

A person has the right to decide about their own body.

This text is a translation of the core idea of the concept of bodily autonomy, which is a fundamental human right.",People should have the right to decide on their own body.
"""Tämä tilanne on sietämätön ja loukkaa ihmisoikeuksia"", sanoo Auer.","""This situation is unbearable and violates human rights,"" Auer says.","""This situation is intolerable and in violation of human rights"", Auer says."
Translain uudistamisesta on puhuttu Suomessa jo pitkään.,The topic of translain (translating) updates has been discussed in Finland for a long time.,Amendments to the Finnish trans act have been on the table for long.
"YK:n ihmisoikeusneuvosto on antanut laista kahdeksan huomautusta ja Euroopan ihmis­oikeustuomioistuimessa on ennakkopäätös, joka velvoittaa ­Euroopan ihmisoikeussopimuksen osapuolet noudattamaan itsemääräämisoikeutta.","The UN Human Rights Committee has issued eight observations on the law, and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling that obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right to self-determination.","The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight concerns regarding the act, and the European Court of Human Rights has a precedent that obligates parties to the European Convention of Human Rights to adhere to the right of self-determination."

Tuli vaalit ja Perussuomalaiset nousivat hallitukseen.,The elections came and the Finns Party rose to power.,"After the following elections, the Finns Party received seats in the Government."
Nyt lakimuutos on jälleen jumissa.,"The translation of the Finnish text to English is:

The law change is stuck again.","Now, the amendments are again at a standstill"
"Kyse on sisäpoliittisista riidoista, jotka eivät edes liity tähän kyseiseen lakiin.",The issue is about internal political disputes that don't even relate to this specific law.,due to internal disagreements that are not even related to this particular act.
"""Hallitus ei halua nostaa sitä pöydälle, koska hallituksen sisällä on erimielisyyksiä lain muuttamisesta"", kertoo Amnestyn Suomen osaston toiminnanjohtaja Frank Johansson.","""The government does not want to bring it to the table, because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law,"" says Frank Johansson, the head of Amnesty International's Finnish section.

Note: The translation is quite direct, but if you want a more idiomatic translation, it could be:

""The government is reluctant to take it up, as there are divisions within the government over changing the law,"" says Frank Johansson, the head of Amnesty International's Finnish section.

This translation uses a more natural English expression to convey the same meaning.","""The Government is not willing to handle the act, as there are disagreements over the amendments within the Government"", says Frank Johansson, director of Amnesty Finland."
Näyttelytilan etuosaa hallitsevat kaksi suurta installaatiota.,The main area of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.,The front of the exhibition area is dominated by two large installations.
Toinen niistä muodostuu Auerin käyttämien lääkkeiden pakkauksista ja käyttöohjeista.,The second one is made from the packaging and instructions of the medications used by Auer.,One of these is made of the packages and instructions of medicinal products used by Auer.
Potilaskertomus-installaatiossa kuka tahansa kävijä voi lukea esimerkiksi Tampereen yliopistollisen sairaalan transpolin psykologin tulkinnan Auerista.,"In the patient record system, anyone can read, for example, the psychologist's interpretation of Auer from Tampere University Hospital's transpolin.","Any visitor to the patient record installation can read, for example, the interpretation a psychologist working in the transgender department of Tampere University Hospital has made of Auer."

Tutkittavan todellisuuden­taju näyttäytyy alttiina horjumiselle.,The awareness of the investigated reality appears susceptible to being undermined.,The patient's sense of reality is reported to be close to shaking.
Tutkittavan käsitys itsestä näyttäytyy rajatilatasoisella tavalla hajanaisena ja persoonallisuuteen liittyvät epävakaat piirteet korostuvat.,"The investigated person's self-concept appears in a fragmented and boundary-like way, and unstable features related to personality are emphasized.",The patient's conception of herself seems to be disorganised as a borderline case and the unstable features of her personality are emphasised.
Auer ei tunnistanut itseään näistä kuvauksista.,"Auer did not recognize himself in these descriptions.

Note: If you provide the full text, I can give a more accurate translation.",Auer does not recognise herself from these reports.
"""Oli järkytys kuulla, että minut diagnosoitiin mielisairaaksi"", Auer sanoo.","""There was shock to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill,"" Auer says.","""It was shocking to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill"", Auer says."
"Vielä suurempi järkytys oli, kun Auerille ei myönnetty sukupuolenkorjaushoitoa.",The bigger shock was when Auer was not granted sex reassignment treatment.,What was even more shocking was that Auer was not given access to gender reassignment surgery.
Hoitohenkilökunnan mukaan hänen voimavaransa eivät olleet riittävät prosessin aloittamiseen.,"According to the nursing staff, his energy reserves were not sufficient to initiate the process.","According to the nursing staff, she did not have sufficient resources to start the process."
Häneltä kiellettiin oma identiteettinsä.,"He was denied his own identity.

(Note: This translation is quite literal and conveys the same meaning as the original Finnish text. If you'd like a more idiomatic translation, it could be something like ""He was stripped of his identity"" or ""He was forced to hide his true self."")",Her own identity was denied from her.
Silloin 11. helmikuuta 2015 ­Auer käveli ulos tapaamisesta ja potkaisi transpolin odotusaulan television hajalle.,"At that time on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the waiting area of the tram stop into pieces with a television.","On that day on 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and smashed a TV in the waiting room of the transgender department."
"Myöhemmin tuosta televisiosta syntyi taideteos nimeltään Monument for the Excluded, jossa Auer reflektoi kokemustaan vallasta ja sen käyttämisestä.","Later, from that television, a work of art was born called Monument for the Excluded, in which Auer reflects on his experience of power and its use.","Later, that TV evolved into a Monument for the Excluded, a work of art through which Auer reflects on her experiences in power and how it is exercised."
"""On hullua, että kuka tahansa syntymässä naiseksi määritelty ihminen voi suurennuttaa rintansa, mutta rintojen poistamiseen tarvitsee diagnoosin"", Auer kertoo.","""It's absurd that anyone born as a woman can enlarge their breasts, but removing breasts requires a diagnosis,"" Auer says.

(Note: I've translated the text as is, but it's worth noting that the original text is quite provocative and might be intended to highlight a specific issue or inequality. The translation aims to convey the original message, but it's essential to consider the context and potential implications of the statement.)","""It's crazy that anyone defined as a woman at birth can have their breasts enlarged. But, to have breasts removed altogether, a diagnosis is needed"", Auer says."
"Kehosi ei ole sinun omasi, jos koet olevasi muuta kuin syntymässä määritelty sukupuolesi määrää.","Your body is not yours if you feel you are something other than the sex assigned to you at birth.

Note: This translation is a direct interpretation of the given text. However, it's worth noting that the original text is a quote from a Finnish LGBTQ+ rights organization, and the translation might be a simplified version of the original message.",You do not own your body if you feel that your gender is not the one defined at birth.
Auerin kokemus ei valitettavasti ole ainoa laatuaan.,Auer's experience unfortunately is not the only one of its kind.,"Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not unique."
Sukupuolenkorjausprosessi on monelle rankempi henkisistä syistä kuin puhtaasti lääketieteellisten operaatioiden takia.,The gender correction process is more difficult for many due to psychological reasons than purely for medical reasons.,"For many, a gender reassignment process is tougher mentally than physically as a result of medical operations."
"Sen läpikäyvät tapaavat kymmeniä ihmisiä, joille pitää perustella omaa olemassaoloaan ja oikeuttaan omaan sukupuolikokemukseen.","They pass through the lives of dozens of people, who have to justify their own existence and their right to their own gender experience.

Note: The translation is quite literal, but it might be worth considering a more idiomatic translation to better convey the meaning and tone of the original text. 

Here's an alternative translation:

They touch the lives of dozens of people, who must constantly justify their existence and their right to their own gender identity.

This translation aims to preserve the original meaning and tone, while using more natural and idiomatic English phrasing.",Anyone who undergoes the process meets dozens of people to whom they must explain their existence and right to a gender identity.
"""On hullua, että ihmisiltä jotka ovat tuen ja avun tarpeessa evätään hoito vedoten siihen, etteivät heidän voimavaransa riitä"", Auer sanoo.","""It's crazy that people who need support and help are being denied care because it's claimed that their resources aren't enough,"" Auer says.","""It's crazy that treatment is denied from people who need help and support by saying that they don't have sufficient resources"", Auer says."
"Monella prosessiin hakeutuneilla on takana psyykkistä oireilua: masennusta, ahdistusta, mahdollisia kiusaamiskokemuksia.","Many who have gone through the process have experienced psychological symptoms behind it: depression, anxiety, possible experiences of bullying.

Note: The translation is quite direct, but it's worth noting that the original text has a somewhat formal tone, which might be lost in translation. If you'd like a more idiomatic translation, I can try to suggest an alternative:

""Behind many who have gone through the process lies a history of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and potential experiences of bullying.""","Many applying for the process have suffered from mental disorders: depression, anxiety and possibly bullying."
"Näihin vedoten hoitohenkilökunta voi määrätä, ettei hoitoa voida aloittaa.","Citing these reasons, the healthcare staff can decide that treatment cannot be started.

(Note: This translation is quite literal and might not be the most idiomatic or natural-sounding English. If you need a more polished translation, please let me know.)","By appealing to these, the nursing staff can decide that the process cannot be started."
"""Hoidon ja avun saamisen estäminen voi syöstä ihmisen vielä pahempaan tilanteeseen, kuin mitä se oli ennen prosessin aloittamista"", Auer sanoo.","""Preventing access to care and support can push a person into an even worse situation than they were in before the process started,"" Auer says.","""If people are not given access to treatment and assistance, their situation may even become worse than it was before the process"", says Auer."
Auerin omakohtainen näyttely käsittelee myös ahdistusta ja ajatuksia itsemurhasta.,Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts of suicide.,Auer's personal exhibit also deals with anxiety and thoughts of suicide.
"Näyttelyjulkaisun tekstissä Auer kirjoittaa: ""Minulla on ollut itsetuhoisia ajatuksia koko aikuisikäni ajan ja se on asia, mitä ihmisten on yleensä vaikea sulattaa"".","The exhibition publication text by Auer reads: ""I have had self-destructive thoughts throughout my entire adult life and it's something that people usually find hard to digest.""","In the exhibition brochure, Auer writes: ""I've had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life, and this is something people find hard to accept."""
"Masennusta on hoidettu lääkkeillä ja kun Auer aloitti hormonien käyttämisen, olo helpottui.","The depression was treated with medication and when Auer started using hormones, the situation improved.","Auer has received medicine for her depression. When she started to take hormones, she also started to feel better."
"Hän oli pystynyt vihdoin sanoittamaan tuntemukset, jotka olivat olleet olemassa jo lapsuudessa ja teini-iässä.",He was finally able to express the feelings that had existed since childhood and adolescence.,She was finally able to put into words the feelings she had had since her childhood and teenage –
Sen miksi leveä leuka ei tuntunut sopivan omaan kehoon ja miksi rinta­lihasten tuli olla pyöreät tasaisen rintakehän sijaan.,"The translation of the Finnish text to English is:

Why a broad chest didn't feel like it fit my body and why the pectoral muscles had to be round instead of being flat for a flat chest.",why her wide chin did not seem to be quite right for her body and why her pectoral muscles were round instead of flat.
"Tärkeintä Auerille on ollut se, että hänen lähellään on ihmisiä, jotka näkevät hänet.","The most important thing for Auer is that there are people around him who see him.

(Note: The translation is quite literal, but it might be worth noting that the original text has a slightly more nuanced tone, implying that Auer values being seen and understood by others.)",Auer has always found it important that she has people who can truly see her close to her.
Nähdyksi tuleminen on perustarve.,"The translation of the Finnish text to English is:

Being seen is a basic need.",Being seen is a basic need.

"Nykyään Auer kokee jo tulevansa nähdyksi, hän on olemassa naisena.","Now Auer feels like she is being seen, she exists as a woman.

Note: The translation might not fully capture the nuances of the original text, but it conveys the main idea. The phrase ""nähdyksi"" can be translated to ""being seen"" or ""being recognized,"" and the phrase ""olemassa naisena"" can be translated to ""existing as a woman"" or ""being a woman.""","Currently, Auer feels that she is seen, and exists as a woman."
Prosessin alkuvaiheessa läheisten sattumanvaraiset kommentit saattoivat kuitenkin satuttaa paljon.,"In the early stages of the process, casual comments from those close by could, however, be quite hurtful.","However, in the first phases of the process, random comments by people close to her hurt."
"Eniten satuttaa se, kun läheiset väärinsukupuolittavat.",The most hurtful thing is when those close to you betray you.,What hurts me the most is when people close to me define my gender incorrectly.

Kaikki transihmiset eivät kuitenkaan kaipaa fyysisiä muutoksia.,Not all trans people desire physical changes.,"However, not all transgender people want physical alterations."
"He eivät kärsi kehodysforiasta eli kehoristiriitaisuudesta, jossa keho tai sen osat voivat aiheuttaa ahdistusta ja jopa fyysistä kipua.","They do not suffer from body dysmorphic disorder, also known as body dysmorphia, where the body or its parts can cause distress and even physical pain.","They do not suffer from the body dysmorphic disorder, whereby their body or its parts can cause anxiety or even physical pain."

"""Näillä tutkimuksille ei ole olemassa minkäänlaista lääketieteellistä perustetta"", Auer sanoo.","""There is no medical basis for these studies,"" Auer says.","""There is no medical basis for these examinations"", Auer says."
Ja se on totta.,And that is true.,This is true.
Esimerkiksi Tanskassa parlamentti hyväksyi kesäkuussa 2014 uuden menettelyn juridisen sukupuolen tunnustamiseen.,"For example, in Denmark, the parliament approved a new procedure for recognizing legal gender in June 2014.","For example, in Denmark, Parliament approved a new procedure for identifying the legal gender in June 2014."
Uusi lainsäädäntö perustuu itsemääräämisoikeuteen juridisen sukupuolen suhteen.,The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to legal gender.,The new legislation is based on the right of self-determination when it comes to the legal gender.

Tätä itsemääräämisoikeutta vaaditaan myös Suomeen ja tähän vaatimukseen kiteytyy myös Auerin näyttely.,This right to self-determination is also demanded in Finland and this demand is also reflected in Auer's exhibition.,"A similar right of self-determination is also demanded in Finland, and this is also what characterises Auer's exhibition."
"Se ei ole ollut taiteilijalle terapiakokemus, vaan näyttely on poliittinen ja taiteellinen teoskokoelma.","It has not been an artistic experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.

Note: This translation is quite literal and direct. If you'd like a more idiomatic translation, it could be:

""It's not been a therapeutic experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a powerful and artistic statement.""",The exhibition has not been any therapeutic experience for the artist; it is a political and artistic collection.
"Haluan uskoa, että taiteella on yhä painoarvoa ja että sen avulla voidaan saada aikaan poliittisia muutoksia, aikana jolloin poliitikot ovat unohtaneet ihmisoikeudet.","I want to believe that art still has value and that it can bring about political changes, in a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.","I want to believe that art still matters and it helps to achieve political changes, during a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights."

Kansalaisoikeusjärjestö antoi matkustusvaroituksen Missouriin,Civil rights organization issued a travel warning for Missouri.,Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
Afroamerikkalaisten kansalaisoikeuksia ajava kansallinen NAACP-järjestö on antanut Missouria koskevan matkustusvaroituksen. Syynä ovat osavaltion syrjivät käytännöt ja siellä tapahtuneet rasistiset hyökkäykset.,"The national NAACP organization, which advocates for the civil rights of African Americans, has issued a travel advisory for Missouri. 

The reason for this advisory is the state's discriminatory practices and the racist attacks that have occurred there.",The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"”NAACP:n Missouria koskeva matkustustiedote tulee voimaan 28.8.2017, ja siinä kehotetaan afroamerikkalaisia matkailijoita, vierailijoita ja paikallisia kiinnittämään erityistä huomiota ja noudattamaan äärimmäistä varovaisuutta matkustaessaan osavaltiossa, jossa on viime aikoina sattunut lukuisia kyseenalaisia rotuun perustuvia tapahtumia”, järjestön tiedotteessa todetaan.","The translation of the Finnish text to English is:

""The NAACP's travel advisory for Missouri will take effect on August 28, 2017, and in it, African American travelers, visitors, and residents are urged to exercise extreme caution and pay particular attention when traveling in the state, where there have been numerous questionable racially motivated incidents in recent times,"" the organization's statement reads.","""The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein,"" the group's statement reads."
Missourissa hiljattain voimaan tullut laki vaikeuttaa syrjintätapausten vientiä oikeuteen. Lisäksi osavaltion lakien täytäntöönpano kohdistuu suhteettomasti vähemmistöihin. NAACP:n mukaan nämä seikat johtivat matkustusvaroituksen antamiseen.,"In Missouri, a recently enacted law has made it more difficult to bring cases of discrimination to court. Additionally, the enforcement of state laws disproportionately targets minority groups. According to the NAACP, these factors led to the issuance of a travel advisory.","A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said."
”Ihmisten kansalaisoikeuksia loukataan.,"""Humans' civil rights are being violated.""","""You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people."
"Heidät pysäytetään ihonvärin perusteella ja pahoinpidellään tai tapetaan”, NAACP:n Missourin puheenjohtaja Rod Chapel totesi Kansas City Star -lehdelle.","""They are stopped based on skin color and beaten or killed,"" NAACP's Missouri president Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.

Note: NAACP is the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a civil rights organization in the United States.","They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed,"" the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star."
”Emme ole aiemmin kuulleet yhtä monesta tapauksesta yhtä lyhyessä ajassa.”,We have not heard of so many cases in such a short time before.,We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before.

"Sanders kuoli kyseenalaisissa olosuhteissa aiemmin tänä vuonna. Hän oli ajamassa osavaltion läpi, kun hänen autostaan loppui polttoaine. Missourin poliisi pidätti hänet, vaikka häntä ei syytetty rikoksesta.","Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year. He was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel. The Missouri police arrested him, although he was not charged with a crime.

Note: The translation is quite literal, and the phrase ""kyseenalaisissa olosuhteissa"" is often translated to English as ""under suspicious circumstances"" or ""under unclear circumstances"". However, the exact nuance of the phrase can vary depending on the context.","Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime."
"Matkustustiedotteessa viitattiin myös Missourin oikeusministerin selvitykseen, jonka mukaan poliisi pysäyttää mustaihoisen kuljettajan 75 prosenttia todennäköisemmin kuin valkoisen.","The travel advisory also referred to the investigation by the Attorney General of Missouri, according to which a black driver is 75% more likely to be stopped by the police than a white driver.",The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.
"”Matkustustiedotteen tarkoituksena on kehottaa ihmisiä olemaan varuillaan ja varoittamaan perheitään, ystäviään ja työtovereitaan siitä, mitä Missourissa voi tapahtua”, Chapel sanoo.","""The purpose of the travel advisory is to warn people to be cautious and to warn their families, friends, and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri,"" Chapel says.","""The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri,"" Chapel said."

Viime aikoina kansalaisjärjestöt ovat kuitenkin julkaisseet niitä vastauksena tiettyihin lakeihin ja kehityssuuntiin Yhdysvalloissa.","Typically, travel warnings are published by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and they concern other countries. However, in recent times, civil society organizations have started publishing them as a response to certain laws and development trends in the United States.","Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US."
