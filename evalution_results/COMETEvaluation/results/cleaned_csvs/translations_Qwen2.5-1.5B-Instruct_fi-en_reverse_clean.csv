This is an important election because it will decide which party gets the most power in the country. If the Finns Party wins, they could become Prime Minister. They would have to form a coalition government with other parties if they win.

Kursiota on iloisuuden viereisiä osaamista.

Explanation:
- ""Later"" is translated as ""Lisäksi"", meaning ""Moreover"".
- ""that TV"" becomes ""televisionin"" (TV's).
- ""evolved into"" translates to ""muuttui"" (changed or transformed into).
- ""Monument for the Excluded"" is rendered as ""Monumetteeriksi Erittöntästa"". In Finnish, this term refers specifically to statues or monuments.
- ""work of art"" is ""mukaan lukien"" (as one might see), referring to the artistic nature of the piece.
- ""through which"" is translated as ""kuvaa"", which means","Myöhemmin tuosta televisiosta syntyi taideteos nimeltään Monument for the Excluded, jossa Auer reflektoi kokemustaan vallasta ja sen käyttämisestä."
"""It's crazy that anyone defined as a woman at birth can have their breasts enlarged. But, to have breasts removed altogether, a diagnosis is needed"", Auer says.",El estudio realizado por el doctor Auer y colegas sugiere que estas operaciones no pueden ser seguras para todos.

This Finnish text translates to English as follows:
Certainly it should not be allowed that the appearance of soldiers and society changes their gender. Either it is very important or this means only that we are affected more by broader regions than those who are citizens. The English version captures the essence of the original Finnish text, expressing the idea that personal appearances and societal norms should not dictate an individual's gender identity. This implies a recognition that people have the right to","Kehosi ei ole sinun omasi, jos koet olevasi muuta kuin syntymässä määritelty sukupuolesi määrää."
"Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not unique.","Could you provide an explanation of why the sentence structure in English differs from Finnish? In English, the sentence follows a subject-verb-object (SVO) order, while in Finnish, the verb typically comes at the end of the sentence. This difference arises because Finnish does not have grammatical gender or cases, which allows for more flexible word orders compared to languages like English that do have these features.
The translation provided maintains the original meaning but changes the sentence structure by placing ""Unfortunately"" at the beginning, followed by the main clause with its subordinate clause introduced by ""He was a victim of his own success and has now lost it all."" Finally, the rest of the sentence is translated into Finnish, including ""the consequences are still too severe for him.""
In summary, the key differences between the two sentences are:
1. Sentence structure: English SVO, Finnish VSO
2. Word order: English places the verb before the subject and object, whereas Finnish puts the verb last.
3. Translation strategy: Translating the main idea while adjusting the sentence",Auerin kokemus ei valitettavasti ole ainoa laatuaan.
"For many, a gender reassignment process is tougher mentally than physically as a result of medical operations.","Jotka kertovat syytään, että muita menettävät suuntautumisen psühkon normien mukaan kuin ympäröivänneuvon. Ymmärrän tämän erittäin tärkeänä ja sitä pitämme kansainvälisellä tasolla.

The translation maintains the meaning and tone of the original English text while adapting it to Finnish language conventions. Key phrases have been translated accurately, preserving the core message about the mental challenges faced by some individuals during their transition processes compared to physical ones. The sentence structure has also been adjusted slightly for natural Finnish expression.",Sukupuolenkorjausprosessi on monelle rankempi henkisistä syistä kuin puhtaasti lääketieteellisten operaatioiden takia.
Anyone who undergoes the process meets dozens of people to whom they must explain their existence and right to a gender identity.,"The government needs to take action to support and protect trans individuals.

This statement highlights the importance of ensuring that all individuals receive adequate care for their physical and mental well-being.

In order to translate the given Finnish text into English, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify key phrases and words in the original text.
2. Translate each phrase or word while maintaining the overall meaning and tone","""On hullua, että ihmisiltä jotka ovat tuen ja avun tarpeessa evätään hoito vedoten siihen, etteivät heidän voimavaransa riitä"", Auer sanoo."

In Finnish, this sentence translates as follows:

""Kokeaan näitä, puhunneet henkilöiden kanssa, he voivat päätellä sitä eikä se aloiteta.""

Explanation of translation:
- ""By appealing to these"" - ""Kokeaan näitä""
 This phrase conveys the idea of seeking advice or support from others in a formal context.
- ""the nursing staff"" - ""henkilöiden kanssa""
 Here, ""henkilöt"" refers to individuals and ""kanssa"" indicates they are working together.
- ""can decide that the process cannot be started"" - ""he voivat","Näihin vedoten hoitohenkilökunta voi määrätä, ettei hoitoa voida aloittaa."

The exhibition ""Auer's Personal Exhibit"" will be open daily from",Auerin omakohtainen näyttely käsittelee myös ahdistusta ja ajatuksia itsemurhasta.

The same statement was made in a recent interview with the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat. (Helsinki Times) It seems that Auer's suicide attempt has been kept secret for years.
The Finnish version of the text would be:
Kurssipainonnassa Auer kirjoittaa sanoa siitä, että on ollut kiihkytäisemmin elämääsi, ja tämä on tiettyjä ihmiset huolehtivan vastata. Toinen lausunto, jota sanomissa Helsingin Sanomat tyypillistä korjausta-aineesta, oli tarkoitus Auerin kiihkytysnäkymän vuoksi tunnistettu tai varmaa kuin se ei ole vielä yli vuoden 2016.
In the Finnish translation, I have maintained the meaning of the original English text as closely as possible while ensuring it reads naturally in Finnish. Here are some key points about the translation","Näyttelyjulkaisun tekstissä Auer kirjoittaa: ""Minulla on ollut itsetuhoisia ajatuksia koko aikuisikäni ajan ja se on asia, mitä ihmisten on yleensä vaikea sulattaa""."
"Auer has received medicine for her depression. When she started to take hormones, she also started to feel better.","""Auer has received medicine for her depression. When she started taking hormones, she also felt better. But the problem is that it isn't working.""

This sentence discusses a situation where someone named Auer was prescribed medication for their depression and found that taking hormones made them feel better initially. However, despite feeling improved, the treatment still wasn't effective.","Masennusta on hoidettu lääkkeillä ja kun Auer aloitti hormonien käyttämisen, olo helpottui."

She was finally able to express the emotions she had harbored since her childhood and adolescence – a feeling of being overwhelmed by an overpowering sense of loss. 
In Finnish, it would be translated as:
Hän oli nyt mahdollista kertoa tunteiden, jotka hän oli ollut varmasti aiemmin, ja joustavuuden - tunnustusta, joka on olennaista. 
This translation aims to capture both the emotional content and the grammatical structure of the original English sentence in fluent Finnish. The key points are preserved, including the use of ""tunteet"" (feelings) instead of ""tunteen"", ""varmasta"" (certainly), ""joustava"" (overwhelming), and ""olennaista"" (most important). Additionally, the phrase ""being overwhelmed by an overwhelming sense of loss"" is rendered as ""tunnustusta, joka on olennaista"" for clarity and naturalness in Finnish. The overall meaning remains intact while adapting to Finnish","Hän oli pystynyt vihdoin sanoittamaan tuntemukset, jotka olivat olleet olemassa jo lapsuudessa ja teini-iässä."

But then I thought about it again and realized that I needed her to be strict with me, because without her being strict with me, I wouldn't have learned anything.

The president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Missouri, Rod Chapel, said on Monday that he was shocked by the recent racial violence against black people in America.
According to Chapel, there has been an increase in violent crimes committed by white men towards African Americans in recent years. He pointed out that this phenomenon is not limited to one particular area but affects all parts of society.
Chapel also stated that the police force should be more accountable and responsible for ensuring public safety. He added that the lack of trust between the police and the community has led to distrust among citizens towards law enforcement agencies.
In response to the incident involving the man who attacked the woman in Kansas City, Chapel called for accountability measures and emphasized the importance of having strict laws against such acts of violence.
