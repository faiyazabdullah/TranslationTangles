The club's members are all men and their main activity is playing rugby on the pitch. It also has an annual football league, which attracts many young people with interest in sport.
The Ulster Lambretta Club was established by the late Ulster Rugby Football Union (URFU) in 1963 and is based in Belfast. It is one of the oldest clubs in Northern Ireland. The club has been in existence since 1978 when it was founded as a youth team for boys. Since then, the club has grown significantly, having played in several tournaments including the All-Ireland Senior Championship and the Ulster Cup.
It is not uncommon for the Ulster Lambretta Club to have different names in different parts of the country. For example, there is a local name in Belfast called ""Ulster Lambretta"" and a local name in Dublin called ""Dublin Lambretta"".
In terms of the club's history, the Ulster Lambret",Pirmasis Alsterio „Lambretta“ klubas įkurtas 8-ojo dešimtmečio pradžioje ir pertvarkytas prieš 12 metų.

As soon as he got there, he learned about the rules and tactics. It was hard work, but he felt happy being part of the team. He became friends with many players who were also interested in football. The more he tried, the more he liked it. He also became very good at football. In 2008, he moved to a different city and began playing for a new club.

The phrase ""unchangeable truth"" is translated as ""pravilno i nezamenljivo je tačan čak"" (which is both true and unchanging), maintaining the emphasis on the consistency of this statement.

The top prosecutor in Illinois is trying to turn the page from a dark period in Chicago police history.,"Translate the following text from en to lt: The top prosecutor in Illinois is trying to turn the page from a dark period in Chicago police history. The Chicago Police Department has been under intense scrutiny for decades, and its reputation as one of the most corrupt and unethical law enforcement agencies in the country has grown over time.
The top prosecutor is working hard to make things right, but the situation remains complex. It's not just about corruption; it also involves issues like bias and lack of transparency.
In this article, we will explore how the top prosecutor is addressing these challenges and providing solutions that are effective in combating crime and maintaining public trust. We will examine the role of prosecutors in ensuring justice, their responsibility towards victims, and the importance of community involvement in policing efforts.
Let us see how the top prosecutor can work together with other law enforcement officers to create a more fair and transparent system that protects citizens' rights and promotes social cohesion.

Corruption continues to plague the department, and there is no sign of any significant change in the near future.",Vyriausiasis Ilinojaus prokuroras bando pakeisti Čikagos policijos istoriją po tamsaus laikotarpio.

You was against him.,"You were against him. He will not come back.

Translation into Latvian:

Vai jā visu, gan visi ne varīga; ne varīga ne varētu.

Latvian translation:

Vai jāvis visu, gan visi ne varīga; ne varīga ne varētu. 

The key points of this Latvian translation are:
- ""Vai"" (meaning ""Was"") is used for ""You""
- ""jāvis"" (meaning ""against"") is used for ""was against""
- ""gan"" (meaning ""he"") is used for ""him""
- ""ne varīga"" (meaning ""not coming back"") is used for ""will not come back""

Note that in Latvian, the word order can be more flexible than in English, so it's possible to rearrange the words to fit better with the original sentence structure. However, the most natural and idiomatic way to express this would be to use the first option as requested by the instruction. 

Also, note that in some contexts, you might want to add a comma after """,Tu buvai jo priešas.
