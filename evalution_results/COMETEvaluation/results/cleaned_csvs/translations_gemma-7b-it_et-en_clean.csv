Esmapilgul on need naised pärit kahest täiesti erinevast maailmast.,"In this sentence, the Estonian word ""esmapilgul"" is not a recognized word. Therefore, I am unable to provide a translation.","On paper, the women are from two very different worlds."
"New Yorgi kinnisvaramagnaat Barbara Corcoran suutis teisendada tuhande dollari suuruse laenu viie miljardi vääriliseks kinnisvaraettevõtteks, enne kui rakendas oma asjatundlikkust teleekraanil, osaledes ABC tõsielusarja ""Shark Tank"" investorite paneelis.","Businesswoman Barbara Corcoran transformed her modest savings of a thousand dollars into a billion-dollar real estate empire in New York City. This remarkable achievement occurred without the aid of traditional financing, as she showcased her expertise on the popular television show ""Shark Tank"" and captivated investors with her insightful business strategies.","New York real-estate tycoon, Barbara Corcoran, turned a $1,000 loan into a $5 billion real estate business, before taking her expertise to the small screen, serving on the panel of investors on ABC's Shark Tank."
"Laila Ali on käinud oma isa jälgedes, saades neljakordse võitmatu tšempionina kõige edukamaks naispoksijaks, enne kui tema resümeesse lisandusid veel telesaatejuhi, autori ja kõneleja rollid.","Laila Ali has followed in her father's footsteps and become the most successful female athlete, winning four consecutive championships. In addition to her competitive achievements, she has also taken on the roles of presenter, author, and commentator.","Laila Ali followed in her father's footsteps, becoming the most successful female in women's boxing as a four-time undefeated champion before adding TV host, author and speaker to her resume."
"Vaatamata nende unikaalsetele karjääriteekondadele (või ehk hoopis nende tõttu) värbas TJ Maxx ometi mõlemad naised, et nad aitaksid rääkida saalitäiele lootusrikastele ettevõtjatele stereotüüpide murdmisest ja kõrgelennuliste eesmärkide saavutamisest.","Despite their unique business models (or perhaps because of them), TJ Maxx has recently hired a significant number of women to address the issue of stereotypes and the setting of unattainable goals for high-achievers.","Yet despite (or perhaps because of) their unique career paths, TJ Maxx enlisted the help of both women to talk breaking stereotypes and accomplishing lofty goals to a ballroom full of hopeful entrepreneurs."
"Eelmisel aastal kõneles T.J. Maxx sadadele naistele poodides üle riigi ja avastas, et 80 protsenti neist tunneb, et ühiskond on seadnud neile stereotüüpselt kindlad rollid ja ootused.","In the spring of this year, T.J. Maxx spoke to women across the country in various shops and discovered that 80% of them believe that society has assigned them stereotypical roles and expectations.","Last year, T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in stores across the country and discovered that 80 percent feel stereotyped by society into specific roles and expectations."

"Corcoron ja Ali teavad sellest nii mõndagi. Nad võivad küll olla praeguseks oma valdkonna tipus, aga teekond sinna ei olnud kummagi jaoks sujuv.","Corona and Ali know about it. They can potentially be at the top of their fields, but the process hasn't been smooth for anyone.","Which Corcoron and Ali know a thing or two about: They may be at the top of their games now, but it wasn't a smooth road to success for either woman."
Corcoran sai keskkoolis ja kolledžis hindeks peamiselt D-sid ja oli töötanud 23-aastaseks saades juba 20 töökohal.,Corcoran graduated from high school and college with mostly D grades and has worked at 20 different workplaces for a total of 23 years.,"Corcoran earned straight D's in high school and college, hopped between 20 jobs by the time she turned 23."
"Ali sisenes ühte kõige meestekesksemasse valdkonda ja lisaks seisis tema teel ees katsumus üritada astuda välja oma isa varjust, kes oli üleilme ikoon.","In one of the most significant moments of his life, he stood before the most powerful state in the world and, besides that, felt the urge to defy his own father who had become an idol to him.",Ali entered one of the most male-dominated industries and had the added struggle of carving out her own place beyond the shadow of her global icon father.
Need kaks pehmelt öeldes pakatavad läbi raskuste omandatud teadmistest.,Two heads are better than one when it comes to overcoming difficulties by utilizing the knowledge gained.,To say the two are brimming with hard-learned advice is an understatement.
"Seetõttu istusime nende mõjukate naistega maha, et rääkida ebaõnnestumiste ületamisest, eduga toimetulekust ning oma kõhutunde usaldamisest äris ja suhetes.","Because of this, I cannot speak with these influential women about overcoming setbacks, educational achievements, and trusting their gut feelings in business and relationships.","So we sat down with the two powerhouses to talk overcoming failure, navigating success and trusting their gut instincts in business and relationships."
"Mis inspireerib teid tegema seda, millega tegelete iga päev?",What inspires you to do what you do every day?,What inspires both of you to do what you do every day?
