Mis on ühist Barbara Corcoranil ja Laila Alil?,What do Barbara Corcoran and Laila Ali have in common?,What do Barbara Corcoran and Laila Ali have in common?
Esmapilgul on need naised pärit kahest täiesti erinevast maailmast.,"At first glance, these women come from two completely different worlds.","On paper, the women are from two very different worlds."
"New Yorgi kinnisvaramagnaat Barbara Corcoran suutis teisendada tuhande dollari suuruse laenu viie miljardi vääriliseks kinnisvaraettevõtteks, enne kui rakendas oma asjatundlikkust teleekraanil, osaledes ABC tõsielusarja ""Shark Tank"" investorite paneelis.","New York real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran managed to turn a $1,000 loan into a $5 billion real estate company before putting her expertise to use on television, as a panelist on the ABC reality show ""Shark Tank"".","New York real-estate tycoon, Barbara Corcoran, turned a $1,000 loan into a $5 billion real estate business, before taking her expertise to the small screen, serving on the panel of investors on ABC's Shark Tank."
"Laila Ali on käinud oma isa jälgedes, saades neljakordse võitmatu tšempionina kõige edukamaks naispoksijaks, enne kui tema resümeesse lisandusid veel telesaatejuhi, autori ja kõneleja rollid.","Laila Ali has followed in her father's footsteps, becoming a four-time undefeated champion as the most successful female boxer before adding television host, author, and speaker roles to her resume.","Laila Ali followed in her father's footsteps, becoming the most successful female in women's boxing as a four-time undefeated champion before adding TV host, author and speaker to her resume."
"Vaatamata nende unikaalsetele karjääriteekondadele (või ehk hoopis nende tõttu) värbas TJ Maxx ometi mõlemad naised, et nad aitaksid rääkida saalitäiele lootusrikastele ettevõtjatele stereotüüpide murdmisest ja kõrgelennuliste eesmärkide saavutamisest.","Despite their unique career paths (or perhaps because of them), TJ Maxx still managed to recruit both women to help speak to entrepreneurs about breaking stereotypes and achieving high-flying goals.","Yet despite (or perhaps because of) their unique career paths, TJ Maxx enlisted the help of both women to talk breaking stereotypes and accomplishing lofty goals to a ballroom full of hopeful entrepreneurs."
"Eelmisel aastal kõneles T.J. Maxx sadadele naistele poodides üle riigi ja avastas, et 80 protsenti neist tunneb, et ühiskond on seadnud neile stereotüüpselt kindlad rollid ja ootused.","Last year, T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in stores across the country and discovered that 80 percent of them feel that society has stereotypically assigned them certain roles and expectations.","Last year, T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in stores across the country and discovered that 80 percent feel stereotyped by society into specific roles and expectations."
"Sellest tulenevalt tulid nad välja projektiga The Maxx You Project, et aidata naistel neid barjääre lõhkuda.","As a result, they came up with the project The Maxx You Project, to help women break down these barriers.",So they launched The Maxx You Project aimed at helping women break those barriers.
"Corcoron ja Ali teavad sellest nii mõndagi. Nad võivad küll olla praeguseks oma valdkonna tipus, aga teekond sinna ei olnud kummagi jaoks sujuv.","Corcoran and Ali know something about this. They may be at the top of their field now, but the journey there wasn't smooth for either of them.","Which Corcoron and Ali know a thing or two about: They may be at the top of their games now, but it wasn't a smooth road to success for either woman."
Corcoran sai keskkoolis ja kolledžis hindeks peamiselt D-sid ja oli töötanud 23-aastaseks saades juba 20 töökohal.,Corcoran received mostly D's in high school and college and had already worked at 20 jobs by the time he was 23 years old.,"Corcoran earned straight D's in high school and college, hopped between 20 jobs by the time she turned 23."
"Ali sisenes ühte kõige meestekesksemasse valdkonda ja lisaks seisis tema teel ees katsumus üritada astuda välja oma isa varjust, kes oli üleilme ikoon.","He entered one of the most masculine fields and in addition, there was a challenge for him to try to step out of his father's shadow, who was a world icon.",Ali entered one of the most male-dominated industries and had the added struggle of carving out her own place beyond the shadow of her global icon father.
Need kaks pehmelt öeldes pakatavad läbi raskuste omandatud teadmistest.,"These two, in a gentle way, offer knowledge gained through overcoming difficulties.",To say the two are brimming with hard-learned advice is an understatement.
"Seetõttu istusime nende mõjukate naistega maha, et rääkida ebaõnnestumiste ületamisest, eduga toimetulekust ning oma kõhutunde usaldamisest äris ja suhetes.","As a result, we sat down with these influential women to talk about overcoming failures, achieving success, and trusting our gut feelings in business and relationships.

Note: The translation is quite literal and may not fully capture the nuances of the original text. The Estonian text uses a more poetic and idiomatic expression, which may be lost in translation.","So we sat down with the two powerhouses to talk overcoming failure, navigating success and trusting their gut instincts in business and relationships."
"Mis inspireerib teid tegema seda, millega tegelete iga päev?",What inspires you to do what you do every day?,What inspires both of you to do what you do every day?
Laila Ali: Mind inspireerivad iga päev mu isiklikud eesmärgid.,Laila Ali: I am inspired every day by my personal goals.,Laila Ali: I'm inspired on a daily basis by my personal goals.
"Olen kujundanud harjumuse kirjutada üles asju, mida soovin saavutada.",I have developed a habit of writing down things I want to achieve.,I make it a habit to write down what it is that I want to accomplish.

"Barbara Corcoran: Nagu Lailalgi, on minu enesekindluse võtmeks liignegi ettevalmistus, kuid ma ei ammuta oma inspiratsiooni sellest.","Barbara Corcoran: Just like Laila, my self-confidence booster is even excessive preparation, but I don't drain my inspiration from it.

Note: Laila is likely a reference to Laila Ali, an American boxer and daughter of Muhammad Ali. However, without more context, it's difficult to confirm the exact reference.","Barbara Corcoran: Much like Laila, over preparation is my key to confidence, but I don't get my inspiration from that."
Tegelikult pakub mulle inspiratsiooni ehe uudishimu.,"The translation of the Estonian text to English is:

""Actually, it gives me inspiration with its fresh curiosity.""

However, a more idiomatic translation would be:

""Actually, it inspires me with its fresh curiosity.""

Or, in a more natural and conversational tone:

""It actually inspires me with its fresh curiosity.""

Note that the original sentence ""Tegelikult pakub mulle inspiratsiooni ehe uudishimu"" is a bit poetic and might not be a direct translation of a common phrase. The translation I provided tries to capture the essence and meaning of the original sentence.",I really get my inspiration from just sheer curiosity.
"Mis juhtub, kui ma seda teen?",What happens if I do this?,What will happen if I do this?
"Mis jääb olemata, kui ma seda ei tee?",What will remain if I don't do it?,What won't happen if I don't do this?
"See uudishimu paneb mind hommikul voodist tõusma, kuna ma ei suuda ära oodata, mida päev endaga toob.","This sense of curiosity makes me get out of bed in the morning, because I'm unable to wait and see what the day will bring.","That curiosity gets my feet on the floor in the morning, because I can't wait to see what the day brings."
"Kui ma mõnel päeval ei tunne sedamoodi, siis lihtsalt teesklen neid tundeid.","If I don't feel that way on some day, then just pretend to have those feelings.","When I don't feel that way on certain days, I pretend I feel that way."
Siis jään iseenda häma uskuma ja saangi jälle inspiratsiooni.,"Then I'll believe in myself again and get inspiration back.

Here's a more idiomatic translation:

Then I'll regain my confidence and get my inspiration back.

Or, in a more poetic translation:

"Rääkige mõnest takistusest oma karjääris, mis muutis teid pikas perspektiivis hoopis paremaks.",Speak about some obstacle in your career that changed you for the better in the long run.,Tell us about a hurdle or a roadblock in your career that ended up making you better in the long run?

"Lõpetasin äri aasta hiljem, kuid see aasta mu elust - viiendaks rattaks olemine - oli kohutav, kuna mul ei olnud piisavalt enesekindlust, et lahkuda.","I finished the business a year later, but that year was terrifying for me, as I didn't have enough self-confidence to leave.","I ended the business a year later, but for that year of my life - being the third wheel - it was terrible, because I didn't have the confidence to leave."

"Seega hakkasin muretsema oma karjääri tuleviku pärast ja pidin leidma aja, et astuda sammuke tagasi ja öelda endale: ""Sul on kõik vajalikud teadmised ja kogemused.","So I started worrying about my career's future and had to find time to take a step back and tell myself: ""You have all the necessary knowledge and experiences.""","So I became concerned about the future of my career and had to take the time to step back and say, ""Hey, you have all the knowledge and expertise."
Sul on kõik need kogemused poksiringis.,You have all those experiences in boxing.,You have all this experience in the ring.
"Sa suudad seda kahtlemata teha.""",You can certainly do that.,"You can definitely do it."""
Niisiis moodustasin enda ümber uue meeskonna ja jätkasin oma karjääri.,"In other words, I formed a new team around myself and continued my career.

Note: 'Niisiis' is an Estonian phrase that roughly translates to 'in other words' or 'to put it simply'.",So I surrounded myself with a new team of people and continued on with my career.
"Tegelikult oli vaja lihtsalt õige meeleseisund saavutada, kuna kõik ülejäänu sai tõuke sealt.","In reality, it was simply a matter of achieving the right mental state, as everything else fell into place from there.",It was really just getting my mindset in the right place because everything kind of took off from there.

Ja kõik lahenes.","I did what needed to be done, I stood face to face with fear and found the courage to break free from my husband and manager and continue my career. And everything worked out.

Note: The translation is quite literal and might not be the most idiomatic or natural-sounding English. A more idiomatic translation could be:

"Läksin kohe välja ning ostsin nii emale kui ka isale uue auto. Neil ei olnud kunagi uut autot olnud. Lasin autod toimetada Floridasse, kus nad oma pensionipõlve pidasid.","I went out right away and bought a new car for both my mother and father. They had never had a new car before.

How did you manage to motivate yourself to continue working throughout this 11-year period?",How did you stay motivated to keep working during that 11-year period?
"Barbara Corcoran: Ma ei mõõtnud oma äritegevust kunagi kasumi järgi, kuna see ei olnud minu eesmärk.","Barbara Corcoran: I never measured my business success by profit, because that wasn't my goal.","Barbara Corcoran: I never measured my business by profit, because that's not what I was in for."
"Soovisin lihtsalt näha, kui kaugele ma suudan jõuda.",I simply wanted to see how far I can reach.,I just wanted to see how far I could go.

"Seega, kui ma aina pingutasin iga päev, iga tund, siis ma tegelikult ei mõelnud raha teenimisele.","So, if I was always struggling every day, every hour, then I was actually not thinking about making money.

Lõpuks teenisin raha kogemata.,"The translation of the Estonian text to English is:

I ended up earning money unintentionally.

However, a more natural translation of the sentence would be:

I ended up earning money by accident.

The word ""kogemata"" in Estonian means ""unintentionally"" or ""by accident"", so the translation should reflect that.",I made money by accident eventually.

Teenisin siis head jootraha ja olin õnnelik.,"The translation of the Estonian text to English is:

Here's a breakdown of the translation:

- ""Teenisin"" means ""I was"" (in the past tense)
- ""siis"" means ""then""
- ""head"" means ""good""
- ""jootraha"" means ""swimmer"" (literally ""swimming hand"")
- ""ja"" means ""and""
- ""olin"" means ""I was"" (in the past tense)
- ""õnnelik"" means ""happy""",I made great tips and I was happy then.

"Ja kui sul on annet, siis sa võid müüa seda kellelegi, kellel on raha, ja hoopis sellega raha teenida.","And if you have a gift, then you can sell it to someone who has money, and with that, earn money.

Note: The Estonian text seems to be a simplified or informal expression, and the translation might not be a direct or formal translation. The original text is likely meant to convey the idea that if you have something valuable (in this case, a ""gift""), you can sell it to someone who has money and use the money to earn more.","And if you have the talent, you can always merchandise your talent to someone who's got the money and make money."
Siin on kaks tahku: anne ja raha.,There are two edges: charity and money.,There's two pieces to it: talent and money.
"Aga kui pole mõlemat koos, ei juhtu midagi eriti suurt.","But if neither of them is together, nothing particularly big happens.","And unless they're together, nothing really big happens."
"Lõppkokkuvõttes on mul - ja ka mu partneritel - kõigi nende aastate jooksul väga hästi läinud üheskoos nende suurpäraste investoritega, keda mul ei oleks kunagi olnud, kui mul poleks olnud julgust leida võitlushimulisi inimesi, kellele meeldib askeldada.","In summary, I - and also my partners - have done very well over the years working together with those great investors, people I would never have met if I hadn't had the courage to find ambitious people who enjoy taking risks.","So I wound up doing very well, as did my partners, over all the years with these great investors that I would have never had if I hadn't had the confidence to get some scrappy person who really wanted to hustle."

What are those two or three things you do every morning that help you achieve success?,Let's talk morning routine: What are two or three things that you do every single morning that set you up for success?
"Laila Ali: Ma ei tea küll teie kohta, aga mul on elus palju hetki, mil ma tunnen end ülekoormatuna, olles ema, ärinaine, abikaasa... kõik need rollid, mida me naistena etendame.","Laila Ali: I don't know much about you, but I have many moments in life where I feel overwhelmed, being a mother, a businesswoman, a wife... all those roles that we women play.","Laila Ali: I don't know about you, but there are lots of times in my life where I feel overwhelmed, just being a mom, a businesswoman, a wife ... all the hats that we wear as women."

"Tänulikkust ülestõusmise, oma tervise, oma laste, oma pere eest.","The translation of the Estonian text to English is:

""Gratitude for the uprising, for my health, for my children, for my family.""

However, a more idiomatic translation could be:

""Gratitude for everything, for my health, my children, and my family.""

Or, in a more poetic sense:

""Gratitude for life, for my health, my children, and my loved ones.""

The original text seems to be a phrase of gratitude, possibly from a prayer or a personal reflection.","Gratitude for waking up, for my health, for my kids, for my family."
"Kirjutan õhtuti tihti üles, mis on minu eesmärgid järgmiseks päevaks. Kui ärkan, siis vaatan seda nimekirja uuesti.","I often write down my goals for the next day in the evening.

Mediteerin.,Meditate.,I meditate.
Mõnikord kirjutan päevikusse.,Sometimes I write in my diary.,Sometimes I journal.
Joon alati tassi kohvi.,"The translation of the Estonian text to English is:

I always drink coffee.

However, the phrase ""Joon alati"" can also be translated to ""I always"" or ""I'm always"", but in this context, ""Joon"" is likely a colloquial or informal way of saying ""I"" or ""me"".",I always have a cup of coffee.
"Ja alati teen hommikul esimese asjana trenni, sest kui ma seda siis ei tee, jääbki see tegemata.","And I always do my training in the morning first, because if I don't do it then, it will never get done.

Note: The translation is quite literal and may not be the most idiomatic or natural-sounding English. A more idiomatic translation could be:

""I always make sure to do my training in the morning, otherwise it would never get done.""

This translation conveys the same meaning as the original, but in a more natural and idiomatic way.","I always work out first thing in the morning, because if I don't, it won't get done."
Minu jaoks on asi lõppkokkuvõttes prioriteetides.,"For me, the thing in the end is priorities.","To me, it really comes down to your priorities."
"Need on asjad, mis on minu jaoks tähtsad: minu spirituaalsus, keskendumine universumile ja Jumalale, seejärel treenimine ning oma tervise esikohale seadmine.","These are the things that are important to me: my spirituality, focusing on the universe and God, then training and putting my health first.

Note: The translation may not be a direct word-for-word translation, but rather a translation that conveys the intended meaning of the text.","Because those are the things that are important to me: my spirituality, centering with the universe and God, and then getting my workout in and putting my health first."
