Note: The term ""tyrimams"" is not directly translatable and seems to refer to some kind of scientific or research activity, possibly related to forestry or environmental studies. In this context, it's likely describing the location where the researcher is working.

The sentence structure has been slightly adjusted for clarity while maintaining the original meaning. It indicates that the runner will cover a certain distance (20 meters) toward an unspecified destination (the Glazgo forest research station). The word ""tyrimams"" at the end suggests that the activity being described involves some form of research or investigation into the area surrounding the station. However, without additional information about what type of research or study is taking place there, we can't provide more specific details about the nature of the research station or its activities.
