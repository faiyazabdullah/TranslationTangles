Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), has called on her party to support a Conservative-led Brexit.
In an interview with BBC Radio Scotland, she said ""the SNP should not be silent when other parties are being told to vote against Brexit"".
She added that ""it is right and proper"" for all political parties to have their say.
The SNP's position on Brexit was set out last week by its leader Nicola Sturgeon in a letter to the UK government.
It stated that the SNP wanted Britain to leave the European Union but did not want it to do so without having a say.
Mrs Davidson also criticised the Conservatives for blocking progress on Brexit talks.
In response, the prime minister Theresa May said Mrs Davidson had ""missed the point"".
Mrs Davidson's comments come as the UK Government is due to publish draft legislation later this month.
However, the Scottish Secretary David Mundell warned that the bill would not be acceptable to the SNP if it included clauses on immigration control.
He claimed that such clauses could lead to the UK leaving the EU under Article 50 without any agreement between the two sides.

The Conservative Party, led by Liz Truss, have also launched their own campaign with the tagline ""Stronger Together"".
In today's article we are going to look at how the two parties' policies align with each other on key issues such as immigration, trade deals, healthcare, education and tax reform.
Let's start with immigration. Both parties agree that there should be a cap on the number of people allowed to enter Britain under certain conditions. They differ slightly on what those conditions are. The Conservative Party supports a cap based on family size while the Liberal Democrats want a cap based on economic need.
Next up is trade deals. The Conservative Party wants closer ties with countries like Australia and New Zealand, while the Liberal Democrats prefer more protectionist measures towards the EU.
On healthcare, both parties believe that it should be","Dabar konservatoriai turi paremti ministrę pirmininkę, leisti jai užbaigti sandorį ir padėti įgyvendinti planus šalyje.",0.4293147027492523

In response, Trump fired her as White House press secretary.
Keyser’s statements have been described by some journalists as “unbelievable” or “ridiculous.” The New York Times has noted that Keyser is a former judge who served on President Obama's cabinet and was also appointed by him to be a federal judge.
Trump has also fired other high-ranking officials since the allegations were made public, including Jared Kushner, the son of Israel’s Prime Minister, and Kellyanne Conway, who worked with Trump for several years before his presidency began.
The scandal involving Judge Kavanaugh stems from an incident where he allegedly sexually assaulted Ms. Carter during a private party at a Washington D.C. hotel in 2016.
This case has brought attention to the issue of sexual assault and harassment against women, especially those in positions of power. It has raised questions about how we treat victims of such crimes and whether there are effective mechanisms in place to hold perpetrators accountable.
In addition to this, the controversy surrounding Kavanaugh has sparked discussions about the qualifications and integrity of the judiciary system.

Kavanaugh also denied that there were any witnesses at the time of the alleged sexual assault and that the allegations against him were false. He further claimed that the events occurred after a period of intoxication and that they were consensual.
The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold hearings on these allegations next month, but it remains unclear what impact this will have on Kavanaugh's confirmation process. The controversy over Kavanaugh has caused considerable debate within the Republican Party, with some members suggesting that he should be removed from consideration for the position due to the potential conflict of interest between his role as an attorney and his current work as a judge.
In addition to the controversy over Kavanaugh, there is another ongoing issue regarding the qualifications of other nominees for the Supreme Court. The Senate is currently considering several nominations, including Amy Coney Barrett, who is a candidate for Chief Justice of the United States.

The man, who has been appointed by Governor Rauner, says he wants to make a difference.
The story of how this man became an advocate for law enforcement reform began with a trip to Chicago in 2015 when he witnessed a shooting and saw the city's police force at its worst. ""I was there in the middle of it,"" said the prosecutor. ""It was not pretty.""
Since then, he has traveled across the country to meet with leaders in law enforcement reform organizations. He has also met with members of Congress and senators, as well as other state officials. His goal is to create a national conversation about police reform that can lead to meaningful change.
The governor recently appointed him to the position of attorney general, which gives him authority over all criminal cases in Illinois. This means that if the new prosecutor decides to pursue legal action against police misconduct, his decisions will have a significant impact on the outcome of those cases.

Wells housing project where a group of corrupt Chicago cops preyed almost risk-free on residents for most of a decade. The 1980s-era building, with its high ceilings and large windows, has been converted into an art gallery.
The Ida B. Wells Housing Project was built in the 1930s as part of the Great Depression era public housing program, but it was never fully utilized due to corruption and mismanagement by city officials. As a result, the property deteriorated over time until it became vacant.
In recent years, the area surrounding the Ida B. Wells Housing Project has seen significant development, including new apartment buildings and commercial spaces. This has led to increased traffic and congestion in the neighborhood, which has negatively impacted local businesses and quality of life for residents.
Despite these challenges, there are efforts to revitalize the area through community involvement and investment. One such initiative involves converting the former Ida B. Wells Housing Project into an art gallery. This project aims to bring attention to the history and struggles of the Black community while also providing a space for artists to showcase their work.
