The given text appears to be describing a sports player's performance over a period of time. The phrase ""za poslední půl rok"" translates to ""in the last half year"", which suggests that the text is discussing the athlete's progress in a particular sport during that timeframe. 
It also mentions ""zazpěvačka"" (singer), ""hlas"" (voice) and ""světové soutěži"" (world championship). These terms are commonly used in Czech but might require some explanation to fully understand their meaning in English.

First, I'll break down the key elements in the English sentence:
- ""Jeden z nich"" - One of them
- ""si nepřivezl"" - brought (literally ""brought himself"")
- ""pouze kolo"" - only a wheel
- ""ale také"" - but also
- ""krabici plnou nevšedně vyhlíž","However, one of them did not just bring a bicycle, but also a box full of unusual looking vibrators.",0.46582889556884766
