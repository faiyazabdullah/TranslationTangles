You can also say ""The foundation of life"" or ""The essence of existence"".

In English, we might rephrase this concept using different words while maintaining its core meaning:

1. **Personal Growth**: Arrival often signifies a new phase in an individual's journey towards self-improvement and development.
2. **New Beginnings**: Arrival represents the start of something fresh and exciting, marking the beginning of new experiences and opportunities.
3. **Transition**: Arrival can symbolize moving from one stage of life (e.g., childhood to adulthood) to the next stage, emphasizing change and progress.
4. **Existence**: In existential philosophy, arrival could refer to the moment when one realizes their true purpose or identity, highlighting the significance of reaching a pivotal point in life.

This translation is correct and accurately conveys the meaning of the original Finnish sentence. Here's a breakdown:

- ""Eniten"" means ""the majority""
- ""satuttaa"" means ""cases""
- ""se"" refers back to ""väärinsukupuolittavat"", which translates to ""opposite-sex couples""
- ""kun"" means ""where""
- ""läheiset"" means ""neighboring""
- ""väärinsukupuolittavat"" means ""opposite-sex couples""

So the complete translation reads: ""The majority of the cases where neighboring opposite-sex couples live together."" This accurately captures the intended meaning of the original Finnish text.
