You are correct. Here is the translation with some minor adjustments for clarity:

„Hromadí se nám dosud největší množství stížností.“,"""We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before.""","Translate the following text from cs to en: „Hromadí se nám dosud největší množství stížností.“
The English translation of the given Czech text is:

""Hromadí se nám dosud největší množství stížností.""

This sentence means ""So far, the largest number of complaints has come to us"" in English. 

It's worth noting that the word order in Czech can be more flexible than in English, and this sentence could also be translated as:

""So far, we have received the largest number of complaints""

or

""We have so far received the largest number of complaints""

depending on the intended emphasis or context. However, the original sentence structure is correct and commonly used in Czech. 

The phrase ""hromadí se"" (has come to) is a common way to express receiving complaints or issues in Czech, often used in formal contexts like reports or statements about customer service or feedback mechanisms. 

The verb ""se nám dosud"" (so far) indicates that this is an ongoing situation up until now.

So the full meaning is clear in the original sentence, but the most natural-sounding English version"

The word ""svobodě"" (freely) in the original Czech can be interpreted as either ""freely"" or ""in the open,"" but it doesn't significantly alter the meaning in this context. The key elements - the cruelty of the people and their action of digging graves - are preserved in the English version.

""There you will find design-oriented and luxurious erotic aids, such as high-quality vibrators, soft silicone dildos, and sensual massage oils.""

This expanded version gives a clearer picture of what kind of items might be included in this category. However, it's important to note that the specific products mentioned would depend on the actual store or website offering these items. 

The term ""luxury"" implies that these products are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing and potentially expensive. Design-oriented means that they are not only effective but also well-crafted and"

Explanation:
- ""Včetně"" translates to ""Including"" or ""In addition to""
- ""od české designérky"" means ""by a Czech designer"" or simply ""by a Czech designer""
- ""Anny Marešové"" is the genitive form (possessive) of ""Anna Marešová"" which is the Czech name for Anna Marešová
You could also say ""Anna Marešová"" without the ""e"" if you prefer to use the full name. The meaning would be the same in this context."

The key elements - the timing (twelve years ago), the inclusion of significant parts of the national economy in the government budget, and the conversion of many commercial enterprises into state-owned entities - are all conveyed accurately.

Martin Ráž si s přáteli vyrazil na cyklovýlet po Moravě.,Martin Ráž and his friends went on a bike tour in Moravia.,"Translate the following text from cs to en: Martin Ráž si s přáteli vyrazil na cyklovýlet po Moravě. The Czech text ""Martin Ráž si s přáteli vyrazil na cyklový let po Moravě."" translates to English as:

""Martin Ráž set out on a cycling trip through Moravia with friends.""

Here's a breakdown of the translation:
- Martin Ráž = Martin Ráž (name remains unchanged)
- si s přáteli = with friends
- vyrazil = set out / departed
- na cyklový let = for a cycling trip
- po Moravě = through Moravia

The word ""cyklový"" is an adjective derived from the noun ""cycling,"" so it fits well in this context. ""Let"" is a common Czech word meaning ""trip"" or ""journey."" ""Moravě"" means ""through Moravia."""

This translation maintains the meaning that when one person (the partner) stopped working for whatever reason and moved on to another job or career, another person took their place or role. The term ""nahradil ho"" directly translates to ""replaced him"" in this context.
You are correct. The translation provided accurately conveys the meaning of the original Czech text. Here is a slightly more polished version for clarity:

But everything changed when I found out that our hosts were very welcoming and would help me find a good place for fun. This article is about how I got into Intimacy and how quickly I could feel"
Je intimní.,It's intimate.,"Translate the following text from cs to en: Je intimní. To translate the Czech phrase ""Je intimní"" into English, we need to determine what it means in context. However, without additional context, this phrase could have different meanings depending on the word order and whether it's a complete sentence or part of a larger statement.

1. If it's meant as ""It is intimate,"" it would be:
   - It is intimate

2. If it's ""Intimate,"" it would be:
   - Intimate

3. If it's ""Is intimate,"" it would be:
   - Is intimate

Given that ""je"" is a form of the verb ""být"" (to be) in Czech, the most likely interpretation without further context is:

- **It is intimate**

So the translation would be:

**It is intimate**. 

If you provide more context, I can offer a more precise translation."
"Je v uličce vedle té hlavní, takže nikdo zákazníky neokukuje,"" pochvaluje si Martin Ráž.","It's in the street near to the high street, so no one can stare at the customers,"" commented Martin Ráž.","Translate the following text from cs to en: Je v uličce vedle té hlavní, takže nikdo zákazníky neokukuje,"" pochvaluje si Martin Ráž. ""Takže nemusím mít strach, že někdo se mnou bude hovořit.""

Translation:

Martin Ráž is praising himself for being in a side street next to the main one, so no customers will overhear us,"" he says.

Explanation of translation:
1. ""Je v uličce vedle té hlavní"" is translated as ""is in a side street next to the main one""
2. ""takže nikdo zákazníky neokukuje"" is translated as ""so no customers will overhear us""
3. ""pochvaluje si Martin Ráž"" is translated as ""he is praising himself""
4. ""Takže nemusím mít strach, že někdo se mnou bude hovořit"" is translated as ""So I don't have to be afraid that someone will talk to me""

Chtěli jsme být první.,We wanted to be the first.,"Translate the following text from cs to en: Chtěli jsme být první. We wanted to be first.

The Czech phrase ""Chtěli jsme být první"" translates to English as ""We wanted to be first."" The phrase consists of:

- Chtěli - we wanted
- jsme - were (past tense of ""být"" [to be])
- být - to be
- první - first

This is a straightforward translation, with no significant cultural nuances that might require additional context or explanation. The sentence is grammatically correct in both languages and conveys the same meaning. 

In English, you would typically use ""were"" instead of ""were"" for the past tense, but in this case, both forms are correct. The original Czech form is more colloquial, while the English ""were"" is more formal, but both are acceptable translations.

Your translation is almost perfect! Here's the polished version:

""They should be ashamed for even entering such a shop.""

This conveys the same meaning with slightly more natural phrasing in English. The word ""even"" emphasizes that it's not just entering the shop, but doing so as if it were acceptable or normal, which implies they should feel ashamed. 

Let me know if you need any other adjustments! The original Russian sentence was quite concise, so I aimed for a similar level of brevity and clarity in English."

I když jsem měl nápad, že bych mohl získat nějaké informace, odkud se ty věci dostaly, nebo jak se na nich zachytit. To bylo zvláštní, protože jsem byl obchodník s drogama a já jsem znal cestu do každého obchodu. Ale ty věci mi připadaly jako něco, co nechápu a o čem jsem se nedokážu vyrozumět.

Additionally, I did not have the feeling that I was going to a store for erotic accessories. Even though I had an idea that I might be able to get some information about where those things came from or how to catch them. That was peculiar because I was a drug dealer and I knew the way to every store. But those things seemed like something I don't understand and can't comprehend.

"Hned u dveří mě překvapila čistá elegance interiéru, kterou znám z butiků s módou.","As soon as I got to the door I was surprised by the clean elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.","Translate the following text from cs to en: Hned u dveří mě překvapila čistá elegance interiéru, kterou znám z butiků s módou. Zde byla všechno o to krásnější a elegantnější, než jsem ji čekal. Všude se honily kousky různých látek a tělesků, ale všechno se zdálo být tak harmonické a uspokojivé.

The English translation of the provided Czech text is as follows:

""Right at the door, she surprised me with the pristine elegance of the interior I'm familiar with from fashion boutiques. Here, everything was even more beautiful and elegant than I expected. Everywhere, pieces of various fabrics and bodies were floating around, but everything seemed so harmonious and satisfying.""

This translation aims to capture the essence of the original text while making it sound natural in English. The key elements are preserved, such as the initial surprise at the elegance, the contrast with expectations, and the overall positive impression of the space. The metaphorical language about pieces ""floating around"" is also maintained to convey the"

The English translation of the given Czech text is:

""While there is only female staff in the store, it doesn't mean that women are hesitant to ask for help, does not mean that a male foot wouldn't fit there as well.""

This translation maintains the meaning and tone of the original text while making it more natural in English. It discusses the context of having only female staff in a store but clarifies that this does not imply men would be unwilling to use the services or facilities. The phrase ""sem mužská noha nezavítala"" (a male foot would not fit) is rephrased to ""a male foot wouldn't fit there"" for better flow in English.

The more frequent way, gentlemen, is to come here to buy presents for their girlfriends.
You are an expert in translating between Czech and English. The sentence you provided appears to be a Czech statement about shopping behavior. Here's the translation into English:

""The more frequent way, gentlemen, is to come here to buy presents for their girlfriends.""

This translation maintains the original meaning and structure of the Czech sentence while adapting it to natural English phrasing. The term ""Povětšinou"" (more frequently) is translated as ""The more frequent way,"" which better fits the context of a statement about shopping habits. The rest of the sentence follows closely, with minor adjustments like changing ""chodí"" (come) to ""is to come"" to improve readability in English. ""Přítelkyně"" (girlfriends) is translated as ""their girlfriends"" to maintain gender neutrality in English."

Martin is smiling as he says, ""Men usually can't estimate the correct size and tend to choose larger ones.""

This translation conveys the meaning of the original Czech sentence in English. The key points are:

- Men (men) are the subject
- They usually can't estimate correctly (they usually can't determine the right size)
- They tend to choose larger sizes (they often go for bigger options)

The phrase ""usmívá se"" (smiling) is translated as ""is smiling"" to maintain the colloquial tone of the original. 

The ellipsis (... ) at the end of the sentence is kept in the translation to preserve the pause or trailing off that may be implied by the speaker's smile.

To mean, a man in good faith might choose a rather large vibrator unnecessarily.

This translation maintains the meaning and structure of the original Czech sentence while adapting it to natural English phrasing. The key elements are preserved:
- ""Takže"" (meaning ""So"" or ""To mean"")
- ""muž v dobré víře"" (a man in good faith)
- ""zvolí"" (might choose)

It means ""Men predominantly choose black underwear, while women usually prefer a rose color."" in English. 

To break it down:
- ""Stejně tak"" = ""Similarly""

- ""černé prádlo"" = ""black underwear""
- ""kdežto"" = ""while""

- ""zpravidla"" = ""usually""
- ""tíhne"" = ""prefers""
- ""spíš k"" = ""more towards""

You can also say ""pink"" for ""růžové"" which is the closest equivalent in English.
You're absolutely right. In English, ""růžové"" translates to ""pink,"" not ""rose."" So"

The expression on my face must be clear that I don't know which one is hitting, because Martin immediately explains how it works.

Your translation is mostly correct, but there's a small adjustment needed for better clarity and flow in English. Here’s a refined version:

""The expression on my face must be clear that I don't know which one is hitting, because Martin immediately explains how it works.""

This maintains the original meaning while improving readability. If you want to make it even more natural-sounding, you could slightly rephrase it:

""Clearly on my face, I don't know which one is hitting, because Martin immediately explains how it works.""

Both versions are accurate translations of the original Czech text. The first one is more direct, while the second one adds a little more emphasis with ""Clearly."" Choose the version that best fits your style or preference."

You are correct. Here is the translation:

To be honest, I find it amusing that when explaining things to me, they do so with such a serious tone.

This preserves the meaning and tone of the original Czech sentence in English.

Jako by se nechumelilo.,As if it didn't phase him at all.,"Translate the following text from cs to en: Jako by se nechumelilo. To translate the given Czech text ""Jako by se nechumelilo"" into English, we need to understand its meaning first. The phrase ""Jako by se nechumelilo"" is a colloquial expression in Czech that roughly translates to ""As if it were not sweaty"" or ""As if it weren't hot.""

So, the English translation would be:

""As if it weren't hot"" or ""As if it weren't sweaty""

The context of this phrase could vary, but it typically conveys a sense of discomfort due to heat or humidity. Here are some possible interpretations in English:

- ""As if it weren't hot.""
- ""As if it weren't sticky.""
- ""As if it weren't uncomfortable.""

The most accurate and common translation would be ""As if it weren't hot."" This captures the essence of the original phrase best. 

Final translation:
""As if it weren't hot."" To further refine the translation based on context, you might consider adding ""due to the heat"" or ""because of the warmth,"" depending on the specific situation. For example:

- ""As if it weren't hot because of the warmth."""
A ono se vlastně nechumelí.,At it really doesn't.,"Translate the following text from cs to en: A ono se vlastně nechumelí. To be honest, they don't stink.
The sentence ""A ono se vlastně nechumelí"" in Czech translates to ""To be honest, they don't stink"" in English. The phrase ""nechumelí"" means ""don't stink"" or ""aren't bad,"" and it's used here in a similar context as ""don't stink."" So, the direct translation conveys the same meaning and intent of the original Czech statement. 

Here is a breakdown:
- ""A"" = ""To be honest""
- ""ono"" = ""they""
- ""se vlastně nechumelí"" = ""don't stink""

So the full translation is: ""To be honest, they don't stink."""

"Nevěřili jsme, že bude tak dobře přijímaný.",We couldn't believe it was so well received.,"Translate the following text from cs to en: Nevěřili jsme, že bude tak dobře přijímaný. We did not believe it would be so well received.
You are an expert in language translation. The sentence structure might look a bit different in English, but the meaning remains the same. Here's the English translation of your Czech text:

""We did not believe it would be so well received.""

This translation accurately conveys the original meaning while adhering to proper English syntax. The phrase ""bude tak dobře přijímaný"" is a direct translation of ""it will be so well received,"" with ""bude"" being the future tense form of ""to be"" (is/are), and ""dobře přijímaný"" being the adjective phrase meaning ""well received."" In this context, ""well received"" is used as an adverbial phrase to describe how the thing was accepted or understood."
Jde o jakousi poslední revoluční novinku.,It's like the most recent innovative revolution.,"Translate the following text from cs to en: Jde o jakousi poslední revoluční novinku.

""It's some kind of last revolutionary novelty. However, most people don't look at it because it's also strange and incomprehensible.""

This translation captures the essence of the original Czech text, maintaining its structure and conveying the same meaning in English. Key elements like ""last revolutionary novelty"" are translated to preserve the metaphorical nature of the statement. The phrase ""Většina lidí se na ni však nedívá"" is translated as ""However, most people don't look at it,"" which maintains the contrasting tone of the original sentence. ""Zároveň zvláštní a nesrozumitelná"" is rendered as ""strange and incomprehensible,"" preserving the double negative and the contrast implied in the original. 

The overall tone and implication that this new concept is revolutionary but difficult to grasp or understand remain consistent between the"

The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the shape of a sea horse. Here is a more polished version of that phrase:

The initial breakthrough came from a specialized sea horse-shaped vibrator.

This translation maintains the core meaning while improving its flow and clarity. I've made a few small adjustments:

1. ""First revolution"" is replaced with ""initial breakthrough"" for a smoother start.
2. ""Způsobil"" (caused) is changed to ""came from"" for better English phrasing.
3. ""ve tvaru"" (in the shape of) is simplified to just ""sea horse-shaped"".
4. The verb ""zvýšil výkon"" (improved performance) is omitted as it's implied by the word ""specialized"".

The text translated from Czech to English is as follows:

""Completely broke down the taboo that can persist for some men and that they see competition in erotic aids. This was the first step towards this decision.""

Note that I've made a few assumptions about the context of the text as it appears to be discussing a change or decision related to viewing erotic aids as competition. The exact meaning may vary slightly depending on the specific context and tone of the original text. However, this translation conveys the general idea presented in your provided text.

""They are creating various variants,"" continues. ""One of them involves using performance for purposes that are not the customer's interests."" 

This change makes the phrasing sound more natural in English while preserving the original meaning. The use of ""creating"" instead of ""doing"" also sounds more appropriate when referring to developing or generating variants. ""Involving"" is used instead of ""for the purpose of"" to maintain a similar flow to the original Czech sentence."
"S jedním motorem, se dvěma motory, s dálkovým ovládáním.","With one motor, with two motors, and with remote control.","Translate the following text from cs to en: S jedním motorem, se dvěma motory, s dálkovým ovládáním. Translated to English, this reads: ""One engine, two engines, with remote control."" To ensure accuracy and clarity, I will provide a more detailed explanation of each part:

- ""S jedním"" means ""One"" (referring to one engine)
