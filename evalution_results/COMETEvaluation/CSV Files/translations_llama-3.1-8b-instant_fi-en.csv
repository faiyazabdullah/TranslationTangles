Näyttelytilan etuosaa hallitsevat kaksi suurta installaatiota.,The front of the exhibition area is dominated by two large installations.,The main area of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
Toinen niistä muodostuu Auerin käyttämien lääkkeiden pakkauksista ja käyttöohjeista.,One of these is made of the packages and instructions of medicinal products used by Auer.,The second one is made from the packaging and instructions of the medications used by Auer.

Auer ei tunnistanut itseään näistä kuvauksista.,Auer does not recognise herself from these reports.,"Translation: 
Auer did not recognize himself in these descriptions.

"""Oli järkytys kuulla, että minut diagnosoitiin mielisairaaksi"", Auer sanoo.","""It was shocking to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill"", Auer says.","""There was shock to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill,"" Auer says."
"Vielä suurempi järkytys oli, kun Auerille ei myönnetty sukupuolenkorjaushoitoa.",What was even more shocking was that Auer was not given access to gender reassignment surgery.,The bigger shock was when Auer was not granted sex reassignment treatment.

But, to have breasts removed altogether, a diagnosis is needed"", Auer says.","""It's absurd that anyone born as a woman can enlarge their breasts, but removing breasts requires a diagnosis,"" Auer says.

(Note: I've translated the text as is, but it's worth noting that the original text is quite provocative and might be intended to highlight a specific issue or inequality.

Here's an alternative translation:

They touch the lives of dozens of people, who must constantly justify their existence and their right to their own gender identity.

This translation aims to preserve the original meaning and tone, while using more natural and idiomatic English phrasing."
"""On hullua, että ihmisiltä jotka ovat tuen ja avun tarpeessa evätään hoito vedoten siihen, etteivät heidän voimavaransa riitä"", Auer sanoo.","""It's crazy that treatment is denied from people who need help and support by saying that they don't have sufficient resources"", Auer says.","""It's crazy that people who need support and help are being denied care because it's claimed that their resources aren't enough,"" Auer says."

Note: The translation is quite direct, but it's worth noting that the original text has a somewhat formal tone, which might be lost in translation. If you'd like a more idiomatic translation, I can try to suggest an alternative:

""Behind many who have gone through the process lies a history of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and potential experiences of bullying."""
"Näihin vedoten hoitohenkilökunta voi määrätä, ettei hoitoa voida aloittaa.","By appealing to these, the nursing staff can decide that the process cannot be started.","Citing these reasons, the healthcare staff can decide that treatment cannot be started.

"Nykyään Auer kokee jo tulevansa nähdyksi, hän on olemassa naisena.","Currently, Auer feels that she is seen, and exists as a woman.","Now Auer feels like she is being seen, she exists as a woman.

Prosessin alkuvaiheessa läheisten sattumanvaraiset kommentit saattoivat kuitenkin satuttaa paljon.,"However, in the first phases of the process, random comments by people close to her hurt.","In the early stages of the process, casual comments from those close by could, however, be quite hurtful."
