This is what happened on Saturday night.
The park was filled with music and excitement as many were enjoying the festivities. However, just before midnight, tensions escalated when an armed man opened fire outside the venue. This led to chaos and confusion among the crowd, causing many to flee in fear for their lives.

In the aftermath, it has been reported that more than 200 individuals have sought medical attention due to injuries sustained during the incident. Some are still being treated in hospital while others remain at home recovering.

It's unclear who or what instigated the shooting, but there seems to be a growing concern about potential violence in public spaces amid political unrest. Authorities are working diligently to secure the area and prevent any further incidents.

Meanwhile, local officials are urging residents to stay calm and avoid unnecessary gatherings in high-risk areas until the situation improves.

The main focus was the ongoing fight against the criminalization of youth, which is still a very real problem in many countries.
Translation:

Explanation for non-Lithuanian speakers:

The original English sentence talks about an event where important social justice topics were discussed during a sunny day. The main point was about fighting against labeling young people as criminals, which is still a big issue in many places around the world.

"About 60,000 people filled the park's Great Lawn for the Global Citizen Festival, also awaiting Cardi B, The Weeknd and other pop stars.","Maždaug 60 000 stebėtojų susirinko į Didžiojoje pievoje vykusį Visuotinį piliečių festivalį, kuriame turėjo pasirodyti Cardi B, The Weeknd ir kitos popžvaigždės.","Translate the following text from en to lt: About 60,000 people filled the park's Great Lawn for the Global Citizen Festival, also awaiting Cardi B, The Weeknd and other pop stars.

The translation is correct. 

""Global Citizen Festival"" is translated as ""globalio kitirovimo festivale"". This phrase refers to an annual music festival that promotes social issues through performances by popular artists like Cardi B, The Weeknd, and others. In Lithuanian, it can be referred to simply as ""Festivalas"" (festival) or in English, ""Global Citizen Festival"".

""Gala galimybes"" translates to ""have the ability"

To translate ""Alastair Seeley continues British Supersport winning run at Assen"" into Lithuanian, you would say:

""Astlākris Seelejs dalyvauja Britanijos supraspektu išlaikymą Āssenai""

This translation preserves the meaning of the original English sentence in Lithuanian. Note that I've used ""dalyvauja"" for ""continues,"" which is a more formal way to express this action than simply saying ""keletas."" The rest of the words are kept as they are because they're common terms in both languages related to motorcycling. 

If you want something even closer to the original phrasing, you could also use:
""Astlākris Seeleysi dalyvavo Britanijos supraspektu išlaikymą Āssenai.""

But ""dalyvauja"" (he/she was involved) sounds more natural and appropriate here in this context."

This is a very serious problem that needs to be addressed immediately.
To solve this issue, we should consider implementing stricter regulations and penalties for those who violate these rules. We can also increase the financial compensation for employees who choose to work remotely instead of staying with their employer's family.
Moreover, we should encourage more flexible working arrangements that allow employees to balance work and personal life better. This will not only improve employee satisfaction but also help reduce stress levels among remote workers.
We need to address this issue promptly as it affects both the employees and their families, which are often left behind when people start living with their employers.
Additionally, we must ensure that the laws protecting employees' rights are enforced effectively. This includes making sure that all companies comply with labor laws, including minimum wage requirements and health and safety standards.
In conclusion, addressing this issue requires immediate action to protect the rights of employees while ensuring that employers can provide a comfortable environment for their staff.

The term ""lambrettas"" refers to the use of a motorcycle as a vehicle for entertainment purposes, such as racing and stunt driving.

Lambrettas were popular among young people during that era because they provided excitement and fun. These motorcycles were often modified by enthusiasts to make them faster or more capable of handling dangerous situations. 

In addition to their recreational value, lambrettas also had practical applications. They could be used as emergency vehicles due to their speed and maneuverability. In some cases, they even served as mobile workshops for mechanics who needed to fix other motorcycles on the go.

While not all lambrettas were built with safety features, many of these machines did come equipped with basic protection like protective covers for the engine and rider's seat. However, accidents still occurred, leading to fatalities. Despite this risk, the popularity of lambrettas continued to grow throughout the 1960s.

The decline of the mod scene eventually led to the demise of lambrettas. Many riders moved on to other types of motorcycling, while others continued to modify their existing lambrettas. However, despite"

Some people are just into the vintage thing.,"Yra ir tokių, kuriems tiesiog įdomus vintažas.","Translate the following text from en to lt: Some people are just into the vintage thing. It's a real trend that is catching on and it will continue to do so in the coming years.

Some people really like the old stuff. They have this fascination with things from the past, and they're not afraid to get creative when it comes to recreating them. Vintage fashion is all about bringing back those classic styles of the past, but also making them unique and different. It's a way for people to connect with their roots and feel more connected to history.
It's an interesting concept that has been around for quite some time, and there are many ways to approach it. Some people prefer to go retro, while others might be more modern. But whatever your preference, vintage can definitely add something special to any outfit or look you choose to wear.
Some people may even see it as a hobby or passion. If you enjoy looking through old magazines or browsing antique stores, then you're probably already familiar with vintage items. There are plenty of resources available online to help you find exactly what you need.
The key is to embrace the nostalgia and appreciate the beauty of these pieces. Vintage clothing can be both practical and stylish, offering comfort and timeless appeal. It's important to remember"

Many of the scooters have been customised and no two are the same. The bikes are made in a factory that is not open to the public.

In English, this sentence translates as:
Manys of the scooters have been customized and there aren't any exactly alike. The bikes are made in a factory which isn't accessible for the general public.

Here's how I translated each part:

1. ""Many of the scooters"" -> ""Manys of the scooters""
2. ""have been customised"" -> ""have been customized""
3. ""and no two are the same"" -> ""there aren't any exactly alike""
4. ""The bikes are made in a factory"" -> ""The bikes are made in a factory""
5. ""that is not open to the public"" -> ""which isn't accessible for the general public""

The car's a little bit old but it still looks great on the outside. The interior is pretty standard, not like a Ferrari or a Lamborghini. But there are some interesting features inside that make it unique. For example, there's an air conditioning system with two fans. This makes the car feel cooler than usual and gives a nice breeze even during summer heat waves. Also, the car has a manual transmission which means you can shift gears manually if you want to save fuel. And lastly, there's a very cool feature called ""auto-dimming rearview mirror."" It automatically darkens when you're driving straight ahead, so you won't see your own reflection while driving down the highway. All these features combined make this car really special.

Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), has called on her party to support a Conservative-led Brexit.
In an interview with BBC Radio Scotland, she said ""the SNP should not be silent when other parties are being told to vote against Brexit"".
She added that ""it is right and proper"" for all political parties to have their say.
The SNP's position on Brexit was set out last week by its leader Nicola Sturgeon in a letter to the UK government.
It stated that the SNP wanted Britain to leave the European Union but did not want it to do so without having a say.
Mrs Davidson also criticised the Conservatives for blocking progress on Brexit talks.
In response, the prime minister Theresa May said Mrs Davidson had ""missed the point"".
Mrs Davidson's comments come as the UK Government is due to publish draft legislation later this month.
However, the Scottish Secretary David Mundell warned that the bill would not be acceptable to the SNP if it included clauses on immigration control.
He claimed that such clauses could lead to the UK leaving the EU under Article 50 without any agreement between the two sides.
The Scottish Secretary also suggested that the new"

The Labour Party has made a number of changes in recent times, including increasing its support for young people and women.

She was referring to the 2015 general election when Labour lost power, but did not mention any other elections or referendums.

As part of her speech, she mentioned that the government should make sure that children are safe online and protect them from cyberbullying.

She also said that it is important to keep an eye on how the government spends public money, especially as they deal with the financial crisis.

However, she didn't seem to agree with the idea that the government should take more responsibility for providing welfare benefits to those who need them.

In terms of foreign policy, she expressed some concern about Russia's influence in Eastern Europe.

She also mentioned that she would like to see a reduction in carbon emissions by at least 30% by 2030.

And finally, she emphasized the importance of protecting the environment and ensuring that all citizens have access to clean water.

She concluded her speech"

The current prime minister is also a man who can be trusted to make tough decisions for his country. He was elected on an anti-austerity platform, and will likely continue to do so despite any challenges ahead.
It would appear then that the two men are well suited for each other in terms of their political ideologies and values.

In today's article we are going to look at how the two parties' policies align with each other on key issues such as immigration, trade deals, healthcare, education and tax reform.
Let's start with immigration. Both parties agree that there should be a cap on the number of people allowed to enter Britain under certain conditions. They differ slightly on what those conditions are. The Conservative Party supports a cap based on family size while the Liberal Democrats want a cap based on economic need.
Next up is trade deals. The Conservative Party wants closer ties with countries like Australia and New Zealand, while the Liberal Democrats prefer more protectionist measures towards the EU.
On healthcare, both parties believe that it should be"

I think we can all agree on one thing, that this has been an extremely important day.
Ms Davidson's statement reflects her commitment to maintaining stability and continuity in Scotland's political landscape. Her message about blocking another independence referendum highlights her belief that such events should not happen too frequently and emphasizes the importance of addressing the concerns of the people who voted against independence.

The sentiment expressed by Ms Davidson aligns with the prevailing view among many Scots that they do not want another referendum as it could lead to further uncertainty and division within the country. The fact that she made this statement during the general election campaign suggests that it is seen as a key issue that voters will consider when deciding their support for the party or candidate they choose.

However, it is worth noting that while Ms Davidson's stance may resonate with many voters, others might have different views on the matter"

Christine Blasey Ford's friend clarifies statement about alleged assault by Brett Kavanaugh,"Christine’a Blasey Ford draugė patvirtino pareiškimą dėl seksualinės prievartos, kuria įtariamas Brettas Kavanaugh‘as","Translate the following text from en to lt: Christine Blasey Ford's friend clarifies statement about alleged assault by Brett Kavanaugh, saying it was a ""hug"". The Washington Post reports that she also says it was not an attack on her person. The New York Times notes this is consistent with the account given by the victim and the accuser's family.
The Post reports that Ford's friend said the incident happened at a party in 2016 when she was 17 years old. She claims it involved a man named Brett Kavanaugh who had been drinking heavily and made advances towards her. However, she says he never touched her and only hugged her for comfort. This event occurred during a time when she did not have any prior sexual experience.
She says she initially reported the incident to police but withdrew the report after learning that Kavanaugh would be nominated as a Supreme Court Justice. Her friend clarified that she felt uncomfortable with how the situation was handled by the authorities and decided to speak out publicly.
This clarification comes as the Senate Judiciary Committee prepares to hold hearings on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. The hearing will likely focus on allegations of sexual misconduct against him.

In response, Trump fired her as White House press secretary.
Keyser’s statements have been described by some journalists as “unbelievable” or “ridiculous.” The New York Times has noted that Keyser is a former judge who served on President Obama's cabinet and was also appointed by him to be a federal judge.
Trump has also fired other high-ranking officials since the allegations were made public, including Jared Kushner, the son of Israel’s Prime Minister, and Kellyanne Conway, who worked with Trump for several years before his presidency began.
The scandal involving Judge Kavanaugh stems from an incident where he allegedly sexually assaulted Ms. Carter during a private party at a Washington D.C. hotel in 2016.
This case has brought attention to the issue of sexual assault and harassment against women, especially those in positions of power. It has raised questions about how we treat victims of such crimes and whether there are effective mechanisms in place to hold perpetrators accountable.

Kavanaugh also denied that there were any witnesses at the time of the alleged sexual assault and that the allegations against him were false. He further claimed that the events occurred after a period of intoxication and that they were consensual.
The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold hearings on these allegations next month, but it remains unclear what impact this will have on Kavanaugh's confirmation process. The controversy over Kavanaugh has caused considerable debate within the Republican Party, with some members suggesting that he should be removed from consideration for the position due to the potential conflict of interest between his role as an attorney and his current work as a judge.
In addition to the controversy over Kavanaugh, there is another ongoing issue regarding the qualifications of other nominees for the Supreme Court. The Senate is currently considering several nominations, including Amy Coney Barrett, who is a candidate for Chief Justice of the United States.

It also states that the judge had been involved in the case involving Dr. Ford, but this involvement ended before the events described by Dr. Ford took place.

The lawyer claims that these facts show that the judge did not know the woman who accused him, nor did he attend any gatherings where she was present. He also points out that there were other people involved in the case besides the judge, including lawyers and law students. Therefore, it can be concluded that the judge was not responsible for what happened to Dr. Ford.

The story has been circulating for years, but it's finally coming to light.
The case involved a white-collar crime that resulted in an innocent man being wrongfully convicted. The victim was a black man named Michael Brown.
A former police officer who worked with Mr. Brown recalled how he was wrongfully accused of murder by a corrupt police department. He said he felt like he was part of a gang of killers.

This is not the first time this story has come up, but until now there had been no concrete evidence or proof that could be presented. Now, however, the truth is out.

It seems that Mr. Brown’s family has decided to go public with their story after receiving death threats against them. They are hoping that sharing their experiences will help bring justice to the victim’s memory.

In addition to the wrongful conviction, the victims’ families also suffered financial losses due to the loss of income during the trial and court proceedings. This includes the funeral costs, legal fees, and other expenses associated with the wrongful conviction.

Despite these challenges, the victims' families have maintained hope that one day they will receive compensation for the harm caused to"

The man, who has been appointed by Governor Rauner, says he wants to make a difference.
The story of how this man became an advocate for law enforcement reform began with a trip to Chicago in 2015 when he witnessed a shooting and saw the city's police force at its worst. ""I was there in the middle of it,"" said the prosecutor. ""It was not pretty.""
Since then, he has traveled across the country to meet with leaders in law enforcement reform organizations. He has also met with members of Congress and senators, as well as other state officials. His goal is to create a national conversation about police reform that can lead to meaningful change.
The governor recently appointed him to the position of attorney general, which gives him authority over all criminal cases in Illinois. This means that if the new prosecutor decides to pursue legal action against police misconduct, his decisions will have a significant impact on the outcome of those cases.
The prosecutor, whose name has not yet been revealed, hopes that his appointment signals a turning point in the relationship between law enforcement and the people they serve. ""We need to build trust again"

Wells housing project where a group of corrupt Chicago cops preyed almost risk-free on residents for most of a decade. The 1980s-era building, with its high ceilings and large windows, has been converted into an art gallery.
The Ida B. Wells Housing Project was built in the 1930s as part of the Great Depression era public housing program, but it was never fully utilized due to corruption and mismanagement by city officials. As a result, the property deteriorated over time until it became vacant.
In recent years, the area surrounding the Ida B. Wells Housing Project has seen significant development, including new apartment buildings and commercial spaces. This has led to increased traffic and congestion in the neighborhood, which has negatively impacted local businesses and quality of life for residents.
Despite these challenges, there are efforts to revitalize the area through community involvement and investment. One such initiative involves converting the former Ida B. Wells Housing Project into an art gallery. This project aims to bring attention to the history and struggles of the Black community while also providing a space for artists to showcase their work.

You was against him.,Tu buvai jo priešas.,"Translate the following text from en to lt: You was against him. You said that he should not be a king.
A new generation of monarchists is rising in Europe and Asia, with many young people expressing their desire for monarchy as a way of restoring order and stability in society. The appeal of the monarchy is growing in popularity because it offers a stable and predictable system of governance that can provide an alternative to the instability and unpredictability of modern democracy.

The rise of monarchism is also being driven by economic factors. Countries where monarchies have been abolished are experiencing significant economic challenges, such as high levels of unemployment and inflation. In contrast, countries with monarchies are generally better positioned to weather these economic storms.

Furthermore, the globalisation of the economy has made it harder for small-scale businesses to compete with large multinational corporations. This has led to a concentration of wealth and power among a few elites, making it difficult for ordinary citizens to achieve upward mobility through traditional means.

Monarchism offers an alternative solution to this problem by providing a more inclusive form of government that recognizes the interests of all segments of society. It allows for greater social mobility and reduces the influence of the elite on political decision-making.

In conclusion, while there may be some who view monarchism as outdated or"

He was also known as an outspoken advocate for civil rights, but his political career took a turn when he started working for a controversial organization called Operation Rescue. This group advocated for abortion rights, among other things. 

In 1987, he became involved in another controversy involving Operation Rescue. He was arrested at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington D.C., where he allegedly spoke about the need to save the unborn child through prayer. The incident sparked outrage and led to his arrest. 

Despite being charged with obstructing justice, Glover was released on bail because there were no witnesses to support the claims that he had made any illegal statements or actions during the event. His case was later dismissed due to lack of evidence.

Glover’s involvement in Operation Rescue brought him back into the spotlight. He continued to speak out on issues related to"
