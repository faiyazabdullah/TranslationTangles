随着中国、韩国和欧盟等比特币主要市场的监管风暴迭起，以比特币为首的全球数字货币本周以来惨遭血洗，比特币价格周二起跌破1万美元心理整数位，并创三年以来最大单日跌幅。,"As the authorities in major markets of Bitcoin -- such as China, South Korea and the European Union -- take decisive regulatory measures, the digital currency market dominated by Bitcoin has experienced major bloodshed this week. The price of Bitcoin has fallen below 10,000 dollar, recording the biggest one-day drop.","As regulatory storms hit major Bitcoin markets like China, South Korea, and the European Union, the global digital currency, led by Bitcoin, has been battered this week. Bitcoin prices fell below the psychological threshold of $10,000 on Tuesday, marking the largest single-day drop in three years."
除了投机属性天然引发的价格回调，本轮数字货币惨跌也与一直以来的“宿敌”——监管风险不无关系。,"A part from the price correction which is natural in speculation, the current round of digital currency tumble has also to do with the 'sworn enemy'—regulation.","Besides the price retracement naturally triggered by the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies, this round of digital currency crash is also inextricably linked to its long-standing ""arch-nemesis"" - regulatory risk. 


Let me break down the key phrases:

* **除了投机属性天然引发的价格回调:** Besides the price retracement naturally triggered by the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies.
* **本轮数字货币惨跌:** This round of digital currency crash.
* **一直以来的“宿敌”——监管风险:** its long-standing ""arch-nemesis"" - regulatory risk.
* **不无关系:** is also inextricably linked to. 



The sentence highlights that while the inherent speculative nature of cryptocurrencies contributes to price fluctuations, the current crash is significantly influenced by ongoing regulatory concerns."
在这个重要的关口，可视化大数据网站HowMuch.net制作了一份图谱，展现比特币在全球各国的合法性地位和受监管程度。,"At this important juncture, HowMuch.net, a visualization big data website, produced a map showing the legitimacy of Bitcoin and regulation measure in place in countries around the world.","At this crucial juncture, the data visualization website HowMuch.net has created a map showcasing the legal status and regulatory scope of Bitcoin in various countries around the world."
如下图所示，绿色代表比特币的合法市场；橘黄色代表中性市场，虽尚未公开合法化比特币地位，但也没有主要的使用限制；淡粉色代表受限制的市场，即当地政府尝试通过红线政策或监管来方法数字货币的使用；深粉色代表比特币被定义为非法的国家；灰色是尚未置评的国家。,"As shown in the figure below, green represents the legal market for Bitcoin, and orange represents the neutral market. Although there is no place where Bitcoin is acknowledged a legal currency, there are no major restrictions on the use it. The pale pink represents the restricted market, i.e. the local government tries to the use of the digital currency pass by drawing a red line or taking regulatory measures. The deep pink represents countries where Bitcoin is declared as illegal. The gray represents countries that have not yet been rated.","As shown in the picture below:

* **Green** represents countries where Bitcoin is legally recognized and traded.
* **Orange** represents countries with a neutral stance on Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is not officially legalized, there are no major restrictions on its use.
* **Light pink** represents countries with restricted markets for Bitcoin. These countries attempt to regulate cryptocurrency use through policies or regulations, often referred to as ""red lines.""
* **Dark pink** represents countries where Bitcoin is illegal.
* **Gray** represents countries that have not yet taken a public stance on Bitcoin."

文章指出，从图中非绿色的色块分布可以看出，传统意义上的东方国家对比特币的态度比西方更为保守。,"The article points out that from the distribution of non-green color patches in the graph, it can be seen that the oriental countries in the traditional sense are more conservative towards Bitcoin than the West.","The article points out that, based on the distribution of non-green color blocks in the chart, countries in the traditional sense of the East have a more conservative attitude towards cryptocurrencies compared to Western countries.

俄罗斯是目前定义比特币为非法的最大国家，中国是比特币最大的受限市场之一，印度是对比特币尚不予置评、还没有出台相关政策的最大国家之一。,Russia is currently the largest country that defines Bitcoin as illegal. China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin. India is one of the largest countries that have not commented on Bitcoin and have not made relevant policies.,"Russia is currently the largest country to have defined Bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin, and India is one of the largest countries that has not yet commented on Bitcoin and has not issued related policies."
北美和西欧是对比特币接受程度最高的地区，即绿色块的分布更为集中。,North America and Western Europe are the regions that have highest level of tolerance to Bitcoin i.e. where green patches are concentrated.,"North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of Bitcoin, with a more concentrated distribution of green blocks. 


**Explanation:**

* **绿色块 (lǜsè kuài)** likely refers to areas on a map or chart that indicate high Bitcoin adoption or usage. 
* The phrase **对比特币接受程度 (duì bǐtèbiàn jiēshòu chéngdù)** means ""degree of Bitcoin acceptance.""

中东和拉丁美洲各国对比特币的看法呈现明显分化，上述地区的色块分布更为混杂。,"The views of the countries in the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin are clearly divided, so, the distribution of color patches in these areas is more mixed.","Opinions on cryptocurrencies in the Middle East and Latin America are sharply divided, with a more mixed distribution of views in these regions. 


Let me break down the translation:

* **中东和拉丁美洲各国对比特币的看法呈现明显分化:**  This means ""Opinions on cryptocurrencies in the Middle East and Latin America are sharply divided.""
* **上述地区的色块分布更为混杂:** This means ""The distribution of views in these regions is more mixed.""  ""色块"" (se kuai) refers to a visual representation of different opinions, often used in maps or charts.

其中伊拉克、伊朗、土耳其、巴西都是合法的比特币市场，阿富汗、巴基斯坦、沙特、埃及、玻利维亚等对其交易和使用有一定程度的限制，更多的拉美国家对比特币还没有发声。,"Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Brazil are all legitimate Bitcoin markets. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bolivia have some restrictions on the trading and use of Bitcoin. Most Latin American countries have not made any comments about Bitcoin.","Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Brazil are all legal Bitcoin markets. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia, and others have some restrictions on its trading and use. More Latin American countries have not yet made a statement on Bitcoin."
综合上述数据可知，在全球受统计的246个国家中，共有99个国家（或占比40%）对比特币的交易和使用不施加限制，即绿色和橘黄色的地区。,"From the above data, it can be seen that of the 246 countries that have been rated, a total of 99 countries (or 40% of the total) haven't imposed any restrictions on the transactions and use of Bitcoin. They are represented by green and orange patches.","Based on the above data, out of the 246 countries globally that are statistically recorded, 99 countries (or 40%) do not impose restrictions on the trading and use of Bitcoin, which are represented by the green and orange areas."
有7个国家（或占比3%）是受限市场（淡粉色），有10个国家（或占比4%）定义比特币为非法（深粉色），有130个国家（或占比53%）还没有更多的对待数字货币信息（灰色）。,"Seven countries (or 3%) are restricted markets (pale pink), 10 countries (or 4%) have defined Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53) %) haven't given comments on digital currency (grey).","There are 7 countries (or 3%) that are restricted markets (light pink), 10 countries (or 4%) that define Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53%) that have no further information on how they treat digital currencies (gray)."
这说明，占全球主体（53%，超过半数）的国家仍在观望以比特币为首的数字货币在境内的合法性，也代表了比特币的“黑天鹅风险”依旧很大，因为其中一部分国家最终可能会作出限制数字货币的立法决定。,"This shows that countries that account for the global majority (53%, more than half) are still indecisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies represented by Bitcoin. This means that the “black swan risk” is still very large for Bitcoin, because some of these countries may ultimately make legislation that restrict the use of digital currencies.","This indicates that the majority of countries (53%, over half) globally are still observing the legality of digital currencies, led by Bitcoin, within their borders. It also represents the significant ""black swan risk"" of Bitcoin, as a portion of these countries may ultimately make legislative decisions to restrict digital currencies. 


**Explanation:**

* **占全球主体（53%，超过半数）的国家:**  This means ""the majority of countries (53%, over half) globally"".
* **仍在观望:** This means ""are still observing"" or ""are still waiting to see"".
* **以比特币为首的数字货币:** This means ""digital currencies, led by Bitcoin"".

文章认为，全球监管机构对数字货币这个新兴类别还没有完全理解，可能是大部分国家还没有作出表态的主要原因。,The article believes that global regulators have not fully understood the digital currency as a new type of currency. This may be the main reason why most countries have not chosen a stance.,The article believes that the lack of full understanding of digital currencies by global regulatory bodies is likely the main reason why most countries have not yet taken a stance on them.
尽管比特币的“人气”自去年以来呈指数级增长，并不代表所有国家都感兴趣，可能有些国家担心当地法币因此受到威胁，或更担心数字货币被犯罪组织利用。,"Although Bitcoin’s popularity has grown exponentially since last year, it does not necessarily mean that all countries are interested in it. It's probably that some countries are concerned that the local currency may be undermined by digital currencies or that digital currencies are used by criminal organizations.","Although the popularity of Bitcoin has grown exponentially since last year, it doesn't mean that all countries are interested.

"斯蒂芬?米勒 (Stephen Miller) 作为特朗普政府的关键智囊之一，在与美国有线电视新闻网 (CNN) 的吉姆?阿科斯塔 (Jim Acosta) 就总统关于严格限制合法移民的提议进行激烈争论时,他肯定知道自己对自由女神像砍出象征性的一斧会发生什么事情。","Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.","As one of President Trump's key advisors, Stephen Miller knew exactly what would happen when he took a symbolic swing at the Statue of Liberty during a heated debate with CNN's Jim Acosta about the president's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration.

* **Stephen Miller:** A prominent figure in the Trump administration known for his hardline stance on immigration.
* **Jim Acosta:** A CNN journalist known for his confrontational style and critical coverage of the Trump administration.

**Explanation:**

* **生吞活剥 (shēng tūn huó pō)** is a vivid idiom meaning ""to tear to pieces"" or ""to devour alive."" It implies extreme violence and anger.
* **游船业主 (yóu chuán yè zhǔ)** refers to owners of pleasure boats, often used for tourism or leisure.

这涉及到拉撒路惊世之语的现代回音，唯一一个国家似乎不仅邀请任何老移民，而且还邀请穷人中最贫穷的人：“你的疲惫、你的穷困、或者你的挤作一团的民众渴望自由呼吸，/苦难的人拒绝你拥挤的海滩。”,"It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: ""Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.""","This touches on the modern echoes of Lazarus's startling words, the only country that seems to not only invite any old immigrant, but also the poorest of the poor: ""Your weariness, your poverty, or your crowded people longing for fresh air, / The suffering refuse your crowded beaches.""

不存在“苦难的人拒绝”在我们的屏幕变得更刺眼的一刻。,"There has never been a time when the ""wretched refuse"" has been more visible on our screens.","There is no ""suffering people refuse"" in the moment our screens become more glaring. 


**Explanation:**

This sentence seems to be a commentary on the way technology, particularly screens, can be overwhelming and potentially harmful. 

* **""不存在“苦难的人拒绝”""** - This translates to ""There is no 'suffering people refuse'"". It suggests that there is a societal expectation or pressure for people who are struggling to accept or endure the harsh realities presented by technology.
* **""在我们的屏幕变得更刺眼的一刻""** - This means ""in the moment our screens become more glaring"". It refers to the increasing intensity and brightness of screens, which can be physically and mentally straining.

The sentence implies a criticism of the way technology is designed and consumed, suggesting that it often ignores the needs and vulnerabilities of those who are already struggling.

* **是一场成功的女权主义政变 (shì yī chǎng chénggōng de nǚquánzhǔyì zhèngbiàn):** is a successful feminist coup
* **(bìng shì):** and
* **是对美国本土主义的毁灭性打击 (duì yī měiguó běnzhǔ zhǔyì de chuǐmièxìng dǎzhē):** a devastating blow to American nativism 



This statement is quite strong and suggests a powerful critique of American nativism through the artistic combination of the poem and painting."
就像拉撒路改变雕像的意义一样，右翼者一直想要把它改回原意。,"And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.","Just as the right wingers have always wanted to restore the statue of Lazarus to its original meaning,  they want to do the same with [something else]. 


**Explanation:**

* **就像拉撒路改变雕像的意义一样:** This phrase means ""Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue.""  It sets up a comparison.
* **右翼者一直想要把它改回原意:** This means ""The right wingers have always wanted to restore it to its original meaning.""

The text implies that there is something else besides the statue of Lazarus that the right wingers want to change back to its original meaning.  You would need more context to know what that ""something else"" is.
