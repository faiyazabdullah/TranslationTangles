Note: This is a literal translation of the Estonian sentence. A more natural-sounding translation in English might be: ""Two women who enjoy gossiping share each other's secrets."""
Mis on ühist Barbara Corcoranil ja Laila Alil?,What do Barbara Corcoran and Laila Ali have in common?,"What is the relationship between Barbara Corcoran and Laila Ali?

(Note: I'm assuming that you are asking about the relationship between these two individuals in a general sense, as I couldn't find any specific information about a personal or professional relationship between them. If you are referring to something specific, please provide more context.)"
Esmapilgul on need naised pärit kahest täiesti erinevast maailmast.,"On paper, the women are from two very different worlds.","At the opening night, these women have come from two completely different worlds."
"New Yorgi kinnisvaramagnaat Barbara Corcoran suutis teisendada tuhande dollari suuruse laenu viie miljardi vääriliseks kinnisvaraettevõtteks, enne kui rakendas oma asjatundlikkust teleekraanil, osaledes ABC tõsielusarja ""Shark Tank"" investorite paneelis.","New York real-estate tycoon, Barbara Corcoran, turned a $1,000 loan into a $5 billion real estate business, before taking her expertise to the small screen, serving on the panel of investors on ABC's Shark Tank.","New York real estate magnate Barbara Corcoran managed to turn a $1,000 loan into a $5 billion real estate empire before showcasing her business acumen on television as an investor on the ABC reality show ""Shark Tank."""
"Laila Ali on käinud oma isa jälgedes, saades neljakordse võitmatu tšempionina kõige edukamaks naispoksijaks, enne kui tema resümeesse lisandusid veel telesaatejuhi, autori ja kõneleja rollid.","Laila Ali followed in her father's footsteps, becoming the most successful female in women's boxing as a four-time undefeated champion before adding TV host, author and speaker to her resume.","Laila Ali has followed in her father's footsteps, becoming an undefeated four-time champion and the most successful female boxer, before adding television host, author, and speaker roles to her resume."
"Vaatamata nende unikaalsetele karjääriteekondadele (või ehk hoopis nende tõttu) värbas TJ Maxx ometi mõlemad naised, et nad aitaksid rääkida saalitäiele lootusrikastele ettevõtjatele stereotüüpide murdmisest ja kõrgelennuliste eesmärkide saavutamisest.","Yet despite (or perhaps because of) their unique career paths, TJ Maxx enlisted the help of both women to talk breaking stereotypes and accomplishing lofty goals to a ballroom full of hopeful entrepreneurs.","Without considering those unique designer brands (or hopefully because of them), both women are certainly encouraged by TJ Maxx to speak to business leaders about breaking stereotypes and achieving ambitious goals."
"Eelmisel aastal kõneles T.J. Maxx sadadele naistele poodides üle riigi ja avastas, et 80 protsenti neist tunneb, et ühiskond on seadnud neile stereotüüpselt kindlad rollid ja ootused.","Last year, T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in stores across the country and discovered that 80 percent feel stereotyped by society into specific roles and expectations.","Last year, T.J. Maxx conducted a survey in rainy weather in stores across the country and found that 80 percent of women feel that society has stereotypically assigned them specific roles and expectations."
"Sellest tulenevalt tulid nad välja projektiga The Maxx You Project, et aidata naistel neid barjääre lõhkuda.",So they launched The Maxx You Project aimed at helping women break those barriers.,"Therefore, they emerged from the project ""The Maxx You Project"" to help women break through barriers."
"Corcoron ja Ali teavad sellest nii mõndagi. Nad võivad küll olla praeguseks oma valdkonna tipus, aga teekond sinna ei olnud kummagi jaoks sujuv.","Which Corcoron and Ali know a thing or two about: They may be at the top of their games now, but it wasn't a smooth road to success for either woman.","Corcoran and Ali know something about it as well. They might be of the same kind, but the journey there has not been suitable for either of them."
Corcoran sai keskkoolis ja kolledžis hindeks peamiselt D-sid ja oli töötanud 23-aastaseks saades juba 20 töökohal.,"Corcoran earned straight D's in high school and college, hopped between 20 jobs by the time she turned 23.",Corcoran mainly received D grades in high school and college and has already worked at 20 different jobs by the age of 23.
"Ali sisenes ühte kõige meestekesksemasse valdkonda ja lisaks seisis tema teel ees katsumus üritada astuda välja oma isa varjust, kes oli üleilme ikoon.",Ali entered one of the most male-dominated industries and had the added struggle of carving out her own place beyond the shadow of her global icon father.,"Ali entered one of the most male-dominated fields and in addition, a gaze met him on his way trying to step out of his father's shadow, who was an ultimate icon."
Need kaks pehmelt öeldes pakatavad läbi raskuste omandatud teadmistest.,To say the two are brimming with hard-learned advice is an understatement.,"Two soft words can help you overcome burdensome knowledge.

Note: This is a loose translation, as the exact meaning of the Estonian phrase ""pehmelt öeldes"" is not entirely clear. It could also be translated as ""gently expressed"" or ""expressed with gentleness."" The word ""teadmistest"" can also be translated as ""from knowledge"" or ""from information."" The context in which this sentence is used would help to clarify the intended meaning."
"Seetõttu istusime nende mõjukate naistega maha, et rääkida ebaõnnestumiste ületamisest, eduga toimetulekust ning oma kõhutunde usaldamisest äris ja suhetes.","So we sat down with the two powerhouses to talk overcoming failure, navigating success and trusting their gut instincts in business and relationships.","Because we sat down with those experienced women to talk about overcoming failures, encouraging future success, and trusting in one's own abilities in difficult situations and relationships."
"Mis inspireerib teid tegema seda, millega tegelete iga päev?",What inspires both of you to do what you do every day?,What inspires you to do what you do every day?
Laila Ali: Mind inspireerivad iga päev mu isiklikud eesmärgid.,Laila Ali: I'm inspired on a daily basis by my personal goals.,"Laila Ali: My personal goals are inspired by someone new every day.

Note: This is a made-up sentence, as I do not have any context about who Laila Ali is or what specific sentence you would like me to translate. However, I used my knowledge of the Estonian language to translate the given sentence to the best of my ability."
"Olen kujundanud harjumuse kirjutada üles asju, mida soovin saavutada.",I make it a habit to write down what it is that I want to accomplish.,I have designed a habit of writing down things that I want to achieve.
Ja ma vaatan seda nimekirja.,And I check that list.,And I am looking for this list.
Pean end vastutavaks.,I keep myself accountable.,"I will be responsible.

The Estonian sentence ""Pean end vastutavaks"" can be translated to English as ""I will be responsible."" The verb ""pean"" is the first-person singular present tense of the verb ""paha"" which means ""will"" or ""shall."" The word ""end"" is a reflexive pronoun meaning ""myself"" or ""himself/herself/itself"" in this context. The word ""vastutavaks"" is the adessive singular form of the adjective ""vastutav"" which means ""responsible."" In summary, the speaker is saying that they will take responsibility for something."
Loomulikult inspireerivad mind mu lapsed.,"My kids inspire me, of course.","Naturally, my children inspire me.

The Estonian sentence ""Loomulikult inspireerivad mind mu lapsed"" consists of two parts: ""Loomulikult inspireerivad"" and ""mind mu lapsed"".

""Loomulikult"" means ""naturally"" or ""by nature"" in English. It is an adverb that modifies the verb ""inspireerivad"".

""Inspireerivad"" is the Estonian present tense form of the verb ""inspireerida"", which means ""to inspire"" in English.

""Mind"" is a reflexive pronoun that refers to the subject of the sentence, which is ""mu lapsed"" or ""my children"" in English.

So, the literal translation of ""Loomulikult inspireerivad mind mu lapsed"" is ""Naturally, my children inspire me""."
Minu ambitsioonid inspireerivad mind.,My ambition inspires me.,My ambitions inspire me.
"Soovin olla võidukas kõiges, mida elus teen.",I want to win at everything that I do in life.,I want to be successful in everything I do.
"Mõistan, et mu eesmärkide saavutamine nõuab ränka tööd, aga olen valmis seda tegema.",I understand that it takes hard work to reach my goals and I'm prepared to do it.,"I understand that achieving my goals requires hard work, but I am ready to do it."

Seega kulutan rohkelt aega ettevalmistamisele.,So I spend a lot of my time preparing.,So I spend a little time preparing.
"Barbara Corcoran: Nagu Lailalgi, on minu enesekindluse võtmeks liignegi ettevalmistus, kuid ma ei ammuta oma inspiratsiooni sellest.","Barbara Corcoran: Much like Laila, over preparation is my key to confidence, but I don't get my inspiration from that.","Barbara Corcoran: Like a butterfly, preparation before taking off is crucial for my self-confidence, but I don't spend my inspiration on that."
Tegelikult pakub mulle inspiratsiooni ehe uudishimu.,I really get my inspiration from just sheer curiosity.,"Actually, the news of something new inspires me."
"Mis juhtub, kui ma seda teen?",What will happen if I do this?,"What happens if I do this?

(Note: The Estonian sentence ""Mis juhtub, kui ma seda teen?"" can have different meanings depending on the context, but a common interpretation is ""What happens if I do this?"")"
"Mis jääb olemata, kui ma seda ei tee?",What won't happen if I don't do this?,"What will be left, if I don't do it?"
"See uudishimu paneb mind hommikul voodist tõusma, kuna ma ei suuda ära oodata, mida päev endaga toob.","That curiosity gets my feet on the floor in the morning, because I can't wait to see what the day brings.","The news in the morning lifts me out of bed, because I cannot wait to see what the day will bring."
"Kui ma mõnel päeval ei tunne sedamoodi, siis lihtsalt teesklen neid tundeid.","When I don't feel that way on certain days, I pretend I feel that way.","If I don't feel like myself on some days, I simply pretend to be those feelings.

The Estonian sentence ""Kui ma mõnel päeval ei tunne sedamoodi, siis lihtsalt teesklen neid tundeid"" can be translated to English as ""If I don't feel like myself on some days, I simply pretend to be those feelings"".

In this sentence, ""ma"" means ""I"", ""mõnel päeval"" means ""on some days"", ""ei tunne"" means ""don't feel"", ""sedamoodi"" means ""like myself"", ""siis"" means ""then"", ""lihtsalt"" means ""simply"", ""teesklen"" means ""pretend"", and ""neid tundeid"" means ""to be those feelings""."
Siis jään iseenda häma uskuma ja saangi jälle inspiratsiooni.,Then I start falling for my own baloney and I get inspired again.,"So I remained true to myself, overcame my shame and found inspiration again."
"Rääkige mõnest takistusest oma karjääris, mis muutis teid pikas perspektiivis hoopis paremaks.",Tell us about a hurdle or a roadblock in your career that ended up making you better in the long run?,Talk about a limitation of your livestock that changed your long-term perspective for the better.
"Barbara Corcoran: Minu jaoks oli kõige raskem, kui mu äripartnerist kallim mind maha jättis ja mu sekretäriga abiellus.",Barbara Corcoran: The hardest thing that happened to me was when my business partner and boyfriend left me and married my secretary.,"Barbara Corcoran: The hardest thing for me was when my dear business partner left me and I was left alone with my secretary.

(Note: This translation is based on the given Estonian text. However, it's important to note that the original English quote from Barbara Corcoran might have been translated or paraphrased into Estonian, which could result in a slightly different interpretation in English.)"
"Lõpetasin äri aasta hiljem, kuid see aasta mu elust - viiendaks rattaks olemine - oli kohutav, kuna mul ei olnud piisavalt enesekindlust, et lahkuda.","I ended the business a year later, but for that year of my life - being the third wheel - it was terrible, because I didn't have the confidence to leave.","I quit my job last year, but that year changed my life - it was invigorating to become a bike rider - as I didn't have enough self-confidence to leave (before)."
"Tundsin end alistatuna, puudus igasugune inspiratsioon.","I felt shot down, uninspired.","I noticed him uninterested, lacking constant inspiration."
Aga hämmastavaid asju juhtub.,But amazing things happen.,"But the most amazing things happen.

Explanation:
The Estonian word ""hämmastavad"" is the plural form of the word ""hämmastav"", which means ""amazing"" or ""astonishing"". The word ""asju"" means ""things"". The word ""juhtub"" is the third person singular of the word ""juhtuda"", which means ""to happen"". So, the sentence ""Aga hämmastavaid asju juhtub"" can be translated to ""But the most amazing things happen"" in English."
"Kõige raskem on uskuda sellesse hetkedel, kui sind tabavad tagasilöögid.","If only you could believe that when you're getting hit, which is the hard part.","The hardest thing is to believe when you are struck by pangs of conscience.

Explanation:
The Estonian word ""tagasilöögi"" is a noun that can be translated as ""pang of conscience"" or ""twinge of conscience."" It refers to the feeling of guilt or regret that one experiences when they have done something wrong or made a mistake.

The word ""uskuda"" is an infinitive form of the verb ""uskuda"" which means ""to believe"" or ""to trust.""

Therefore, the sentence ""Kõige raskem on uskuda sellesse hetkedel, kui sind tabavad tagasilöögid"" can be translated as ""The hardest thing is to believe when you are struck by pangs of conscience."""
Enda jalule ajamisele ja äri uuesti nullist alustamisele - seekord ilma partnerita - kulunud aasta oli äärmiselt raske.,"But getting back up and starting the business all over again, minus the partner, was a very, very difficult year.","The past year, spent on restarting your business and personal life from scratch without a partner, has been extremely difficult.

Note: In this context, ""enda jalule"" refers to ""your personal life"" or ""yourself"". It is a reflexive form of ""you"". ""Ajamisele"" means ""on spending time"" or ""on the activity of spending time"". ""Äri uuesti nullist alustamisele"" means ""on restarting your business from scratch"". ""Seekord"" means ""again"" or ""once more"". ""Ilma partnerita"" means ""without a partner"". ""Kulunud aasta"" means ""the past year"". ""Oli äärmiselt raske"" means ""has been extremely difficult""."
"Laila Ali: Ma ütleks, et minu karjääris oli kõige raskem aeg siis, kui ma tegelesin poksimisega, olin oma karjääri tipus ja otsustasin lahutuse sisse anda.","Laila Ali: I would say one of the toughest times I've had in my career was when I was in boxing, I was at the height of my career and decided I was going to get a divorce.","Laila Ali: I would say that the most difficult time for me as a boxer was when I was competing, I was in my prime and decided to retire.

Note: Laila Ali is a former professional boxer and the translation is in the context of her experiences as a boxer."
"Ma ei lahutanud ainuüksi oma abikaasast, vaid ka tollasest mänedžerist ja inimesest, kes õpetas mulle kõik, mida tean poksimise kohta.","I was divorcing not only my husband, but also my manager at the time and the person who taught me everything I knew about boxing.","I did not only lose my grandmother, but also a trusted manager and a person who taught me everything I know about boxing."
"Ma ei uskunud, et suudan ilma temata hakkama saada.",I didn't think that I could do it without him.,"I didn't think I could start without a topic. (Literally: ""I didn't believe that I can manage to start without a theme."")"
"Seega hakkasin muretsema oma karjääri tuleviku pärast ja pidin leidma aja, et astuda sammuke tagasi ja öelda endale: ""Sul on kõik vajalikud teadmised ja kogemused.","So I became concerned about the future of my career and had to take the time to step back and say, ""Hey, you have all the knowledge and expertise.","So I started to worry about my farmer's future and spent a lot of time trying to go back step by step and tell myself: ""You have all the necessary knowledge and experiences."""
Sul on kõik need kogemused poksiringis.,You have all this experience in the ring.,"You have all those experiences in your pocket.

The Estonian word ""poksiring"" translates to ""pocket"" in English. Therefore, the sentence ""Sul on kõik need kogemused poksiringis"" can be translated to ""You have all those experiences in your pocket"" in English."
"Sa suudad seda kahtlemata teha.""","You can definitely do it.""","""You are allowed to do this without hesitation.""

The Estonian phrase ""Sa suudad seda kahtlemata teha"" can be broken down into several parts. ""Sa"" means ""you"", ""suudad"" is the permissive form of the verb ""suudma"" which means ""to be able"", ""seda"" refers to ""this"", ""kahtlemata"" is an adverbial form of the word ""kahtlemine"" which means ""to hesitate"", and ""teha"" means ""to do"". So, when put together, the phrase means ""You are allowed to do this without hesitation."""
Niisiis moodustasin enda ümber uue meeskonna ja jätkasin oma karjääri.,So I surrounded myself with a new team of people and continued on with my career.,"In this way, I formed a new community around myself and continued my shepherding."
"Tegelikult oli vaja lihtsalt õige meeleseisund saavutada, kuna kõik ülejäänu sai tõuke sealt.",It was really just getting my mindset in the right place because everything kind of took off from there.,"Actually, it was simply necessary to achieve the right state of mind, because all the remaining strength came from there."
"Tegin seda, mida oli vaja teha, pidin seisma silmitsi hirmuga ja leidma julguse vabaneda oma abikaasast ja mänedžerist ning jätkata oma karjääriga. Ja kõik lahenes.",I did what I needed to do and I had to face that fear and find the courage to get rid of my husband and my manager and continue on with my career and it worked out.,"I did what was necessary, I stood there shivering with fear and mustered up the courage from my grandmother and manager and continued with my work. And everything went on."
"Millal tundsite, et olete tõesti edu saavutanud?",You felt like you really made it when ...,"When did you find out that you have truly succeeded?

Note: In Estonian, the word ""edu"" can have different meanings depending on the context. In this case, it seems to be used in the sense of ""success"" or ""achievement."""
"Laila Ali: Tundsin, et olen edu saavutanud, kui võitsin oma esimese meistrivõistluste tiitli.",Laila Ali: I felt like I really made it when I won my first championship title.,Laila Ali: I realized that I had achieved success when I won my first championship title.
"See oli tõeliselt hea tunne, kuna poksimisega alustades soovisin olla üks parimatest, olla võitmatu.","It really felt good, because when I entered the sport of boxing I wanted to be one of the best and be undefeated.","The feeling was truly good, because as I started practicing, I wanted to be one of the best, to be invincible."
"Ma suutsin selle sihi saavutada ja ma ei võitnud meistrivõistluste tiitlit mitte ühel, vaid neljal korral.","And I was able to attain that, not just one championship title, but four.",I aimed to achieve this title and I didn't win the championship title in any (of the competitions) except for four times.
"Barbara Corcoran: Üks hetk, mil tundsin, et olen edu saavutanud, oli mu üheteistkümnendal tegutsemisaastal.",Barbara Corcoran: The one point that I felt like I made it was my eleventh year of business.,Barbara Corcoran: One moment when I realized that I had achieved success was in my eighteenth year of business.
Olin lõpuks kasumisse jõudnud.,I finally made a profit.,"I have finally ended up in debt.

The Estonian sentence ""Olin lõpuks kasumisse jõudnud"" can be translated to English as ""I have finally ended up in debt."" The word ""olin"" is the first-person singular past tense of the verb ""olema"" which means ""to be,"" ""lõpuks"" means ""finally,"" ""kasumisse"" is the elative case of the word ""kasu"" which means ""debt,"" and ""jõudnud"" is the first-person singular past tense of the verb ""jõuda"" which means ""to end up."""
"Olin teeninud ligikaudu 42 000 dollari suuruse kasumi, mida ma ei osanud oodata.","I had close to $42,000 in profit that I was not expecting.","I had accumulated a debt of 42,000 dollars, which I did not expect."
"Läksin kohe välja ning ostsin nii emale kui ka isale uue auto. Neil ei olnud kunagi uut autot olnud. Lasin autod toimetada Floridasse, kus nad oma pensionipõlve pidasid.",So I immediately went out and I bought my mother and father each a new car; they had never had a new car and I had it delivered to Florida where they were retired.,"I just went out and bought not only a car for mom but also a new car for dad. They have never had new cars before. I had the cars delivered to Florida, where they will be spending their retirement."
Tundsin end nagu Inglismaa kuninganna.,I felt like the queen of England.,"I knew him like an English king.

The Estonian sentence ""Tundsin end nagu Inglismaa kuninganna"" is a little unusual because it uses the comparative form ""nagu"" to compare knowing someone to knowing an English king. A more literal translation might be ""I knew him as if an English king,"" but this doesn't convey the intended meaning as clearly as the translation I provided.

It's worth noting that the sentence doesn't specify which English king is being referred to, so the translation doesn't either. If the context makes it clear which king is meant, you could add that information to the translation for clarity."
Tundsin end nii lahedana.,I felt so cool about myself.,I knew him so well.
"Teenisin sellest järgnevatel aastatel palju enam, kuid miski ei ole suutnud siiani pakkuda samaväärset tunnet kui võimalus anda oma vanematele midagi tagasi ja neid üllatusega rabada.","I made much better money than that in ensuing years, but nothing ever measured up to the ability to give back to a parent and take them by surprise.","In the following years, I will be able to give much more, but nothing has been able to offer the same feeling as the opportunity to give something back to my elders and surprise them."
"Kuidas te suutsite selle 11-aastase perioodi vältel end motiveerituna hoida, et töötamist jätkata?",How did you stay motivated to keep working during that 11-year period?,How did you manage to stay motivated and continue working without a break during this 11-year period?
"Barbara Corcoran: Ma ei mõõtnud oma äritegevust kunagi kasumi järgi, kuna see ei olnud minu eesmärk.","Barbara Corcoran: I never measured my business by profit, because that's not what I was in for.","Barbara Corcoran: I never measured my success by money, because it was not my goal."
"Soovisin lihtsalt näha, kui kaugele ma suudan jõuda.",I just wanted to see how far I could go.,"I simply want to see how far I can get.

Explanation: This is a word-for-word translation of the original Estonian sentence. In Estonian, the sentence is in the optative mood, which expresses a wish or a hope. In English, we can use the simple present tense to convey the same meaning."
Seadsin endale juba esimesel päeval unistuse saada New Yorgi kinnisvarakuningannaks.,"I set my dream, day one, ""I want to be the queen of New York real estate.""","I dreamed of becoming the real estate queen of New York already on my first day.

Note: In Estonian, ""kinnisvarakuninganna"" directly translates to ""real estate queen"". However, in English, we would say ""real estate mogul"" or ""real estate tycoon"" to refer to a powerful and wealthy figure in the real estate industry. So, a more natural-sounding translation might be:

I dreamed of becoming a real estate mogul in New York already on my first day."
Ja nägin end vaimusilmas justkui paavstina - kõik suudlevad mu sõrmust ja jumaldavad mind.,And I pictured myself just like the Pope with everybody kissing my ring and adoring me.,"And I saw you in a dream just like a pope - everyone is kissing your hand and worshiping me.

Note: The Estonian sentence contains some irregularities and it's not entirely clear what the intended meaning is. The translation provided is based on a possible interpretation of the original sentence."
Mu peas oli selline väike mõte.,And I had that little idea in my head.,I had such a small thought on my mind.
"Seega, kui ma aina pingutasin iga päev, iga tund, siis ma tegelikult ei mõelnud raha teenimisele.","So when I was running hard, day after day, hour after hour, I never really thought about making money.","So, if I was always knocking (lit. pinguing) every day, every hour, I actually didn't think about earning money.

In this context, ""pingutasin"" likely means ""asking for money"" or ""trying to get money"" rather than physically knocking on something. Here is a more natural translation:

So, if I was constantly asking for money every day, every hour, I truly wasn't thinking about earning it."
Lõpuks teenisin raha kogemata.,I made money by accident eventually.,"In the end, I earned money without even trying.

The Estonian sentence ""Lõpuks teenisin raha kogemata"" can be translated to English as ""In the end, I earned money without even trying."" The word ""lõpuks"" means ""in the end"" or ""finally,"" ""teenisin"" is the first-person singular past tense of the verb ""tegema"" which means ""to do"" or ""to make,"" ""raha"" means ""money,"" and ""kogemata"" is the past participle of the verb ""kogema"" which means ""to earn"" or ""to gain."" So, the sentence can be interpreted as ""I finally made/did money without even earning/gaining it."""
"Aga kogu raha, mis sisse tuli, suunasin kohe tagasi ärisse.","But any money I saw coming in, I plowed right back into the business.","But all the money that came in, I immediately directed back to the account.

Explanation: The Estonian sentence ""Aga kogu raha, mis sisse tuli, suunasin kohe tagasi ärisse"" consists of several parts. ""Aga"" means ""but"", ""kogu"" means ""all"", ""raha"" means ""money"", ""mis"" is a relative pronoun meaning ""that"", ""sisse"" means ""in"", ""tuli"" is the third person singular of the verb ""tulema"" meaning ""to come"", ""suunasin"" is the first person singular of the verb ""suunata"" meaning ""to direct"", ""kohe"" means ""immediately"", ""tagasi"" means ""back"", and ""ärisse"" is the inessive case of the word ""ara"" meaning ""account"" or ""purse"". So the whole sentence can be translated as ""But all the money that came in, I immediately directed back to the account."""
"Ma isegi ei usu, et mul üldse oli heidutavaid päevi, kus oleksin mõelnud, et oh jumal, me ei teeni raha.","I don't even think I had discouraging days where I thought, ""Oh God, we're not making money.""","I still don't believe that there were ever days when I thought that God, we don't need money."
"Ma lihtsalt olin veendumusel, et miski hakkab toimima.",I just figured something was going to work out.,I simply was confident that something will start working.
"Kõige hullem, mis võinuks juhtuda, olnuks ettevõtte kaotamine ja uuesti ettekandjaks hakkamine.",The worst that could happen is I lose my company and go back to being a waitress.,"Of all the terrible things that could happen, it would be the collapse of a company and starting again as a novice."
Teenisin siis head jootraha ja olin õnnelik.,I made great tips and I was happy then.,"So, I had a good mood and was happy.

The Estonian sentence ""Teenisin siis head jootraha ja olin õnnelik"" can be translated into English as ""So, I had a good mood and was happy."" The word ""teenisin"" is the first-person singular past tense of the verb ""tegema"" which means ""to have"" or ""to be in a certain state."" The word ""siis"" can be translated as ""so"" or ""therefore."" The word ""head"" means ""good"" and ""jootraha"" is a noun that can be translated as ""mood"" or ""feeling."" The word ""olin"" is the first-person singular past tense of the verb ""olema"" which means ""to be."" The word ""õnnelik"" means ""happy."""
Võiksin jälle õnnelik olla.,I could be happy again.,"I could be happy again.

The Estonian sentence ""Võiksin jälle õnnelik olla"" can be translated to English as ""I could be happy again"". The word ""Võiksin"" is the first person singular conditional form of the verb ""võida"" which means ""can"" or ""to be able to"". The word ""jälle"" means ""again"". The word ""õnnelik"" means ""happy"" and ""olla"" is the infinitive form of the verb ""to be"". So, the whole sentence means ""I could be happy again""."
"Seetõttu ma ei usu, et paljude edu saavutanud inimeste suureks püüdluseks on raha.",So I don't think money's a great aspiration for a lot of people that succeed.,Because I don't believe that money is the main goal for many people who have achieved success.
"Neil on teised ajendid, mis neid kannustavad.",They they have other motivations that turn them on.,There are other motivations that drive him.
Ja raha ei olnud üks minu omadest.,And money was not one of mine.,And money was not one of my possessions.
"Kas teil on mõni nõuanne kellelegi, kellel on sellised suured unistused, kuid keda hoiab tagasi rahaline tegur?","Do you have advice for someone who has those big dreams, but the money factor is holding them back?","Do you have any questions about someone who has such big dreams, but is held back by a financial factor?"
"Barbara Corcoran: Kui ma hakkasin teenima palju raha, oli mul raha, mida kinnisvarasse investeerida, kuid mul ei olnud aega.","Barbara Corcoran: When I started making a lot of money, I had money to invest in real estate, but I didn't have the time.","Barbara Corcoran: When I started making a lot of money, I had money to invest in real estate, but I didn't have the time."
Rajasin ettevõtet.,I was building a business.,"I started a business.

Explanation:
The Estonian word ""ettevõtja"" means ""entrepreneur"" or ""businessman/businesswoman"", but in the context of your sentence, it's more likely that you meant to say that you started a business. Therefore, I translated it as ""I started a business"" instead of ""I became an entrepreneur""."
"Ja seetõttu leidsin ma endale viis erinevat partnerit, kes ei olnud isegi spetsialistid maakleriäris, vaid erinevates naabruskondades kõikjal linnas, kes tundsid oma tänavaid läbi ja lõhki.","And so I found myself five different partners, who were specialists not even in the brokerage business, in different neighborhoods around the city, who knew their streets inside and out.","And so I found myself five different partners, who were not even specialists in real estate, but all from different neighboring districts in the city, who knew their streets by heart and were familiar with them."
"Ma lähenesin neile ja ütlesin: ""Sa tunned seda naabruskonda.","And I approached them and said, ""You know this neighborhood.","I approached them and said, ""You must know this neighborhood.""

Note: In Estonian, the informal form of ""you"" (sa) is used, which I have translated as ""you"" in English. However, if the context requires a more formal tone, the translation could be ""You must know this neighborhood."" using ""you"" (informal) would be more appropriate if the speakers are on friendly terms or if the speaker is addressing children or close friends."
Leia mulle parim hoone.,Find me the best building.,"Read me the best house.

The translation might not make much sense in English because the sentence in Estonian seems to be a command or request to read about the best house, rather than the actual best house itself. A more natural way to say ""the best house"" in Estonian would be ""parim korter"" or ""parim maja,"" depending on the context."
"Ma annan sulle raha ja sinust saab minu partner.""","I'll give you the money and you be my partner.""",I will give you money and you will become my partner.

Siin on kaks tahku: anne ja raha.,There's two pieces to it: talent and money.,"Here are two options: kindness and money.

The Estonian text ""Siin on kaks tahku: anne ja raha"" can be translated to English as ""Here are two options: kindness and money"". The word ""tahku"" means ""option"" or ""alternative"", ""anne"" means ""kindness"" or ""generosity"", and ""raha"" means ""money""."
"Aga kui pole mõlemat koos, ei juhtu midagi eriti suurt.","And unless they're together, nothing really big happens.","But when neither of them are together, nothing particularly great happens.

Explanation:

* ""Aga"" is a conjunction that can be translated as ""but"" or ""however"".

"Lõppkokkuvõttes on mul - ja ka mu partneritel - kõigi nende aastate jooksul väga hästi läinud üheskoos nende suurpäraste investoritega, keda mul ei oleks kunagi olnud, kui mul poleks olnud julgust leida võitlushimulisi inimesi, kellele meeldib askeldada.","So I wound up doing very well, as did my partners, over all the years with these great investors that I would have never had if I hadn't had the confidence to get some scrappy person who really wanted to hustle.","In conclusion, both my partner and I have very successfully collaborated with those major investors throughout all these years, whom I would have never met if I hadn't had the courage to approach potential allies."

Mulle meeldib üles tõusta ja lihtsalt tunda tänulikkust.,I like to wake up and just feel gratitude.,"I enjoy climbing and simply feeling spirituality.

The Estonian word ""tänulikkus"" can be translated as ""spirituality"" or ""transcendence"" in this context. It refers to a sense of connection to something greater than oneself, often experienced during activities like climbing or meditation. The word ""üles tõusta"" means ""climbing"" or ""ascending,"" and ""meeldib"" means ""enjoy"" or ""like."" The sentence structure is a little different from English, but the meaning is clear."
"Tänulikkust ülestõusmise, oma tervise, oma laste, oma pere eest.","Gratitude for waking up, for my health, for my kids, for my family.","For the sake of consciousness raising, for your health, for your children, for your family.

Mediteerin.,I meditate.,"The Estonian word ""Mediteerin"" is most likely a typo or a misspelling, as it is not a recognizable Estonian word. However, if it is meant to be the English word ""Mediteranean"", then the correct Estonian translation would be ""Mediteraani""."
Mõnikord kirjutan päevikusse.,Sometimes I journal.,"Sometimes I write in my diary.

Explanation:
The Estonian sentence ""Mõnikord kirjutan päevikusse"" consists of three parts:

1. ""Mõnikord"" - an adverb meaning ""sometimes""
2. ""kirjutan"" - the present tense of the verb ""kirjutama"" (to write)
3. ""päevikusse"" - the illative case of the noun ""päevik"" (diary), which can be translated as ""into my diary"" or ""in my diary""

So, the whole sentence can be translated as ""Sometimes I write in my diary""."
