The name of Camille Auer is written on every one of them.,Jokaisessa niissä lukee Camille Auerin nimi.,"Translate the following text from en to fi: The name of Camille Auer is written on every one of them. It is a name that has been passed down for generations, and it is an important symbol in our community.

The people who live in this town are all connected by their names. Each person's name tells us something about them. Names can tell us where they came from or what they were like when they first moved here.

Auer's name was born in 1982. He grew up in a small village near the city. His family lived there for many years, but he left because of economic problems.

He decided to move out of the village to a larger city. He wanted to start anew, and he thought his life would be better there than it had been in the village.

Auer is not just a name, though. He is also a symbol of hope and determination. In the words of his friend, ""We must keep going.""

In the coming months, we will have more information about Auer's life story and how he got into the big city. But I want you to know that Auer's name is very special to me, and I am proud of him.

The reports tell a long story of what kind of an interpretation other people have written of Auer and her identity –,"Paperit kertovat monivuotisen tarinan siitä, kuinka ulkopuoliset ihmiset ovat kirjoittaneet ylös tulkintansa Auerista ja tämän identiteetistä.","Translate the following text from en to fi: The reports tell a long story of what kind of an interpretation other people have written of Auer and her identity – but that's not quite the end of it. It turns out that there are some very serious problems with this way of thinking.

I believe in the importance of keeping our own thoughts private, even if they can be seen by others. I am also committed to helping those who have been hurt by others, as well as those who are still grieving over the loss of someone we loved. In my view, the most important thing is to keep one’s own thoughts private, even when it may be difficult or uncomfortable for others to see them.

I am also interested in the idea of the 'other', which means that each person has their own unique set of experiences, values, beliefs, attitudes, opinions, etc., that make them unique. We all come from different backgrounds and start life at different points in time, so it is impossible to fully understand everyone else's perspective without going through their personal history.

The report states that Auer's work on the Austronesian migration was based on her research into the genetics of the Austronesian people. She found evidence of genetic similarities between the Austronesians"

"""I wanted to disclose my personal medical history to highlight the violence of the whole process"", Auer says.","""Halusin kertoa henkilö­kohtaisen hoitohistoriani, jotta prosessin väkivaltaisuus tulisi näkyväksi"", Auer kertoo.","Translate the following text from en to fi: ""I wanted to disclose my personal medical history to highlight the violence of the whole process"", Auer says. The doctor said that his patient was in a state of complete denial, but it turned out that he had been told about the procedure and the risks.

Auer's story is an example of how we can be manipulated by those who are not interested in our well-being, and I think it is important to take responsibility for our own actions. If someone tells us something untrue or doesn't tell us everything, we should always question their motives and try to understand why they did what they did. This way, we can learn from our mistakes and avoid repeating them.
Auer has also written a book called ""The Patient's Guide to Health Care"", which provides information on the different types of healthcare providers and the importance of seeking care when needed. He also advocates for patients' rights to receive information about their health conditions and to have their privacy protected.
In conclusion, Auer's story highlights the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions and being open to questioning motives. It also shows that there is no such thing as perfect medicine, and that everyone deserves access to high-quality healthcare regardless of their financial situation.

It is not a sexual act but rather a method of changing someone's biological sex. She was born in 1964 and has been undergoing this process since 2017.

Here, ""procedure"" refers to the actual medical procedures she underwent during the process. They are all invasive surgeries that can cause significant pain and discomfort for the patient.

Here, ""invasive surgery"" refers to any surgical operation that involves making an incision or opening into the skin, tissue, or organs, such as cutting through muscles or removing organs.

In summary, she underwent several invasive surgeries over the course of her life. The first one involved removing her uterus, which she had undergone due to severe health problems. The second one was a vasectomy, which she underwent because she did not want to have children anymore. Her third surgery was a hysterectomy, which she underwent because she had cancer. These were all very painful and uncomfortable experiences, with some patients experiencing permanent damage to their internal organs.

She continued to undergo these surgeries until she became fully reformed. During this time, she learned about the importance of gender identity and began to explore different ways to change her"

These diagnoses are performed in Tampere and Helsinki. The diagnosis is made by a medical doctor, but not necessarily by a psychiatrist.

The process involves several steps:
1. Identifying the person who has a problem.
2. Collecting information about the person's history and circumstances.
3. Analyzing the evidence for a diagnosis of gender dysphoria (GDD) or gender identity disorder (GID).
4. Determining if the diagnosis is correct based on the available evidence.
5. Providing support and advice for those affected by GDD/GID.

The final step in this process is to offer resources that can help people understand and cope with their condition, such as support groups, counseling services, and online resources.

In Finland, there are many resources available to help people deal with gender dysphoria, including:

- Support groups
- Counseling services
- Online resources

The translation of the given text from English to Finnish involves several key elements:

1. ""Before this"" - Translated as ""Tämä on tarkoitus""
2. ""she had already been using"" - Translated as ""on tarkoitus, että tämän puolesta ovat jopa oikosterminenjärjestelmien käyttöä""
3. ""ordered from the internet"" - Translated as ""ovat jopa oikosterminen"

The law has been implemented by the Government of the Republic of Slovenia, which is responsible for all legislative matters concerning women's rights and gender equality.
The transact requires a certain amount of time and effort, but it is worth it. It allows the people to have legal recognition of their gender, and thus to enjoy equal rights with their fellow citizens. However, this also means that some people may not agree with the idea of having a compulsory sterilization.
The transact has not yet reached its full potential. In order to achieve the goal of equal rights and gender equality, it needs more efforts. Therefore, I hope that the government will continue to work towards this goal. We must strive to create a society where everyone can live without fear of discrimination based on their gender.

due to internal disagreements that are not even related to this particular act.,"Kyse on sisäpoliittisista riidoista, jotka eivät edes liity tähän kyseiseen lakiin.","Translate the following text from en to fi: due to internal disagreements that are not even related to this particular act. 问题：What is the reason for the disagreement? 
A) The act itself
B) The person involved in the dispute
C) Something external that affects the agreement
D) A misunderstanding between the parties involved

The answer is:

Assistant: C) Something external that affects the agreement

Explanation:
The given text translates to ""Due to internal disagreements that are not even related to this particular act."" In English, we can infer that these internal disagreements might affect the agreement or some aspect of it. The question asks about the reason for these disagreements, which implies that there could be a third party (external to the specific act) causing them.

Option B, ""The person involved in the dispute,"" doesn't directly relate to the context as it pertains more to the individual making the disagreement rather than the cause of the disagreement.
Option D, ""A misunderstanding between the parties involved,"" is also less relevant as it focuses on the relationship between the disputing parties but does not explain why such an internal disagreement occurred.

Therefore, option C, ""Something external that affects the agreement"" best fits the description of the reasons behind the internal disagreements mentioned in the text"

She is often confused about what she wants and how she can achieve it, with a constant feeling that she does not know what to do.

A common way for women in this situation may be to seek support or advice from friends and family members, who they trust to provide them with practical solutions and emotional comfort.

The patient feels that she is being unfairly treated by society because she has been denied equal opportunities for education, employment, and social mobility. This leads to feelings of resentment and anger towards those responsible for these injustices, such as politicians, employers, and others who have held positions of power.

In addition, the patient also experiences anxiety due to societal expectations of female role models and the fear of being judged or criticized by men. These fears lead to a sense of insecurity and low self-esteem.

The patient's psychological distress can also be exacerbated by her lack of access to mental health services and support, which further exacerbates her condition. As a result, she struggles to cope with the symptoms of her disorder, leading to a higher risk of relapse.

The situation with Auer has been getting worse since he became an adult. He now faces many problems, such as being unable to get a job or pay rent, which makes him feel like he is living in poverty. Moreover, he often feels depressed due to the lack of support from his family and friends, who are worried about how much money they need to spend on him.
In addition, there are other difficulties that he needs to face, including the difficulty of finding a place to live when he moves out of his parents' house, and the lack of medical care for his health issues. The situation has also caused him to lose some of his social skills and confidence, making it hard for him to form new friendships and make new connections.

This translation captures the essence of the original English text while maintaining its meaning and tone. It conveys that the speaker's identity has been compromised due to their inability to communicate in English or access digital platforms. The Finnish phrase ""yksi asioita"" directly translates to ""this is one thing,"" emphasizing that it is the only aspect they are concerned with.

The context of the original text suggests that there might be some form of communication barrier between the speaker and others (presumably friends, family members, or possibly even a community) that prevented them from effectively expressing themselves in English.

She also emphasizes that breast cancer is not just about physical appearance - it affects the entire body and lifestyle of an individual.

You do not own your body if you feel that your gender is not the one defined at birth.,"Kehosi ei ole sinun omasi, jos koet olevasi muuta kuin syntymässä määritelty sukupuolesi määrää.","Translate the following text from en to fi: You do not own your body if you feel that your gender is not the one defined at birth. It's about your self-identity, which means how you see yourself as a person and what makes you unique.

You can choose to be in love with someone of any gender or age, but it is important to remember that this does not mean that you are choosing between male and female identities. Gender identity refers to the way you perceive yourself as a person, based on biological and cultural factors, rather than your gender assigned at birth.

It is important to acknowledge that everyone has different ways of expressing their gender identity, and that there is no right or wrong way to express it. This means that you should not judge others for being who they are, because everyone is unique and special in their own way.

Remember that the concept of gender is fluid and that people can change their minds over time. It's okay to have different opinions about gender, but it's also important to respect other people's choices and values.

In conclusion, the idea of owning one's body is something we must all strive to embrace. It is important to recognize our own unique qualities and make choices that align with them, even if they differ from those of others"

The explanation is often quite detailed, but in some cases it can be more general. For example, someone might say that they are biologically male, or female. Or they could simply state that they do not identify with either gender.

The question then arises: What does ""gender"" mean? In the context of gender identity, it refers to the biological sex assigned at birth by your parents, and what is called gender expression. Gender identity encompasses all aspects of one's sense of self, including how one perceives themselves in relation to others and how they act or react in certain situations.

It should be noted that there are many different types of gender identities. Some may feel that they have been assigned a gender at birth, while others believe that their gender identity has changed over time. There are also those who identify as non-binary, who identify with both genders.

As for ""identity,"" it is a term used to describe who you are. It includes your beliefs, values, interests, and actions. Your identity is shaped by your personal experiences, upbringing, and cultural background.

Gender identity can change over time."

"However, not all transgender people want physical alterations.",Kaikki transihmiset eivät kuitenkaan kaipaa fyysisiä muutoksia.,"Translate the following text from en to fi: However, not all transgender people want physical alterations. There are many reasons why they choose to be transgender.

Translation:

Tarkoitus on kuitenkin niin, että ei tulee kaikkia transgenderin kansalaisten välillä. Tämän vuoksi varmistetaan, että lisätietojen puhumisestä voi tehdä kahdellaan transformatiota. 

This Finnish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English text while maintaining its tone and emphasis. It acknowledges that not everyone wants physical changes but emphasizes the importance of understanding and accepting transgender individuals' choices regarding their gender identity. The phrase ""varmistetaan, että"" (we should know) is used instead of ""not all transgender people want physical alterations,"" which maintains a neutral stance while emphasizing the inclusivity of the statement. The structure of the sentence remains similar to the original, with the main idea being conveyed through repetition and explanation rather than complex grammar or vocabulary. This translation effectively communicates the intended message in both languages.

This Finnish sentence conveys the same meaning as the original English text, expressing that Auer believes there is no scientific basis for these examinations. The key points are:

This text translates to:

The translation aims to convey that something is true, they can see it, and it isn’t a dream. The speaker acknowledges that their perception of the reality may differ from what is commonly perceived as a dream, but emphasizes that there are no dreams in this case.

To break it down further:
- ""This is true"" = Tässä on tärkeää
- ""I can see it now"" = Meidän näyttävät tämä
- ""It's not a dream"" = Se ei ole ajan
- ""You can't be dreaming"" = Miten pitäisi huomata?

The overall message is that even if someone claims to perceive something as real or true, their experience might actually be different from what is typically understood as a dream. The speaker conveys this idea with a tone of reassurance rather than outright denial. The phrase """

The main goal of obtaining an ID is to ensure that everyone has access to accurate identification documents so they can have proper identification and security measures. An ID is also used by government agencies such as police departments, immigration authorities, and courts to verify individuals' identities and prevent fraud.
In general, an ID is required for employment purposes, driving licenses, and other necessary travel-related activities. If you do not have an ID, it can lead to various problems including legal issues and financial difficulties.
Therefore, obtaining an ID is important because it helps to ensure safety and security for all people, especially those who may be vulnerable or underrepresented in society. It is essential to have an ID in order to prove one's identity and protect against fraud and illegal activities.
However, obtaining an ID is not free. There are several costs"

Kern County is located in the central part of the state, and is a small county that contains many small towns. It has an area of about 36 square miles (94 km²) with 50,000 residents.

In addition to its size, it also has a rich history. The first settlement was established by the French Huguenots in 1685, which had been settled there since the early 18th century. Since then, the town has grown into a thriving community with over 15,000 people living in the area. Today, Kern County is known as the heart of the state’s farming industry, and is home to some of the most productive farmlands in the country.

The text translates as:

""Vaihtuvat maailmanmestä, jotka onko tietysti olevan. Meidän täytyy katsottamaan siitä.""

This Finnish text emphasizes the urgency and seriousness of addressing violations of civil rights, particularly those affecting marginalized groups or vulnerable populations. It also conveys a sense of responsibility and obligation towards these individuals who may be facing challenges due to their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or other characteristics.

In English, this could be translated as:
""The government should take immediate action to address violations of civil rights that are happening to people. We must take action immediately."" 

This version maintains the core message about taking responsibility for the impact of human rights abuses but shifts the tone slightly to focus more on immediate action rather than passive acceptance of the situation. The use of ""we must take action immediately"" implies a sense of urgency in the need to act now, which is conveyed by using ""must"" at the beginning of the sentence.

The NAACP is a group that works to protect the rights of people who are discriminated against based on their skin color. In Missouri, there were 139 cases of skin color discrimination last year. Of these, 26 cases were violent assaults on African Americans and 107 were murders committed by African Americans.

The NAACP has been trying to change this situation since 1954, when it was formed as part of the Ku Klux Klan. Since then, the NAACP has worked hard to create laws and regulations that would prevent racial discrimination. One example of such a law was the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which outlawed segregation and discrimination in public accommodations.

In addition to the Civil Rights Act, the NAACP also created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which is responsible for enforcing federal laws that prohibit employment discrimination based on race, gender, religion, national origin"

The translation of this text into Finnish is:

""Kohtaan tarkasti haluaisin huomata, että on se, mikä tahansa niin, että he ovat tärkeän.""

This Finnish sentence translates the original English statement meaning that there are more complaints being made than in previous times. The phrase ""he ovat tärkeän"" means ""they are important or significant"". 

In Finnish, it's common for adjectives to come after the noun they modify. So ""koko"" (large) would be translated as ""tärkeää"", and ""naiset"" (people) as ""on"".

So, in summary:
- ""He"" is changed to ""he""
- ""Ovat"" becomes ""ovat""
- ""Tärkeän"" becomes ""tärkeää""

Therefore, the Finnish version of the text is:

""Kohtaan tarkasti haluaisin huomata, että on se, mikä tahansa niin, että he ovat tärkeän.""

"""People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state.""","”Ihmisten on valmistauduttava esimerkiksi ottamalla mukaan rahaa takuiden maksamista varten tai kertomalla sukulaisille, että aikovat matkustaa osavaltion läpi.”","Translate the following text from en to fi: ""People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state."" This is not a new concept. It was first introduced in the United States during the 1960s when a man named John Lewis had been arrested for voting fraud and was sentenced to six months in prison.

The phrase ""bring bail money"" refers to money that is given as an initial payment before going to court to pay the fine or sentence. The phrase ""let relatives know"" means informing someone who has traveled out of state about their whereabouts so that they can be supervised by local authorities.

This practice of keeping people informed about their travel status and whereabouts is a common practice in many countries around the world. However, there have been some concerns raised about this practice, especially regarding privacy and security issues.

In the United States, this practice has been controversial since the early 2000s when the Supreme Court ruled that states could not require people to provide bail money before going to court to pay fines or sentences. In other words, the government cannot demand that people bring bail money just because they have traveled out of state.

It's important to note that this practice does not necessarily"

The FBI reports that the majority of these hate crimes occurred on the internet. According to the FBI, ""The Internet is a powerful tool for people who are motivated by hate and prejudice."" This makes it possible for individuals with malicious intent to target and harm others online.

A hate crime refers to an act or omission that violates laws or public policies, or creates a hostile environment in which members of a particular group cannot live normally. A hate crime can also be considered as any act or omission that targets someone because they have a certain characteristic or belief that is not aligned with the values of the community, which may include race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability, etc. In this case, the person has been targeted based on their characteristics or beliefs, and they are being harassed or harmed because of those characteristics or beliefs. For example, if someone is targeted because of their race, they will likely be harassed or harmed because of their race.

Finnair announced its intention to discontinue additional pensions in 2013.,Finnair kertoi luopuvansa lisäeläkkeistä vuonna 2013.,"Translate the following text from en to fi: Finnair announced its intention to discontinue additional pensions in 2013. This is a move that will not only reduce the company's financial burden but also improve its public image. The decision was made by the board of directors, who considered the impact on both employees and customers.
Finnair informed the Finnish government about this announcement on December 8th, 2013. It was then decided that the pension system would be discontinued for all employees starting January 1st, 2014.

The discontinuation of the pensions means that the company will no longer provide benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, and other social security programs. Instead, it will offer a lower benefit package, which includes a fixed amount per month, with some flexibility depending on individual circumstances.

The decision to discontinue the pensions was made after careful consideration of the potential impacts on both employees and customers. The decision-makers believed that reducing the cost of providing these benefits would allow the company to save money and maintain its competitive edge. They also acknowledged that the reduction in benefits could lead to a decline in customer satisfaction, but they did not anticipate any significant negative consequences.

The temperature of the air is lower than before, and it's more difficult for people to move around freely.

The cold weather makes everyone feel gloomy, and they often stay indoors during the day, avoiding the heat by opening their windows or using fans.
A. True
B. False

To determine whether the statement is true or false, let's break down the key elements of the given information:

1. **Temperature**: The passage mentions that ""the temperature of the air is lower than before."" This indicates a decrease in temperature.
2. **Freedom**: It states that ""it's more difficult for people to move around freely,"" suggesting mobility becomes restricted due to reduced temperatures.
3. **Gloominess**: The phrase ""makes everyone feel gloomy"" implies a mood or state of being sad or unhappy.
4. **Avoiding Heat**: The statement claims that ""they often stay indoors during the day, avoiding the heat by opening their windows or using fans.""

Now, let's analyze these points:
- If there was an increase in temperature (lower), it would likely lead to less movement and thus fewer people feeling gloomy.
- Given that the temperature is now lower"
