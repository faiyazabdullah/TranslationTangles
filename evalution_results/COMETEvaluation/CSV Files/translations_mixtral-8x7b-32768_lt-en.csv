Kelyje su Alsterio „Lambretta“ klubu,Rolling with the Ulster Lambretta Club,"On the road with Alsterio ""Lambretta"" club

Tai buvo šioks toks sportas.,It was a bit of sport.,"That was such a sport.

The Lithuanian sentence ""Tai buvo šioks toks sportas"" is a sentence fragment, as it is missing some context to determine what specific sport is being referred to. However, the translation of the sentence itself is ""That was such a sport."""

Note: The translation might not be entirely accurate as the context and some specific terms are not provided. The Lithuanian text mentions ""Alsterio"", which seems to be a specific name for a Lambretta club, but it's not a standard term, so it was kept in the translation."
"„Apie 1971 m. motoroleriai ir kitos transporto formos vis mažiau domino žmones, be to, klubai apskritai nukentėjo dėl neramumų, todėl pagalvojau: „Viskas, tai galas“, – sakė Chrisas.","""It started to die out around 1971, the interest in scooters, other forms of transport and the Troubles didn't help with clubs in general, so I thought, 'No that's it, finished',"" Chris said.","""By 1971, motorcycles and other forms of transportation were becoming less popular, and to make matters worse, clubs were declining due to lack of interest,"" Chris said.

„Visų motyvai skirtingi.,"""Everyone's got their own take.","""Motives are all different.""

Note: This is a literal translation of the Lithuanian sentence. The sentence ""Motives are all different"" might not be grammatically correct or make sense in English, depending on the context. If you could provide more context, I could give you a more accurate translation."

Note: The Lithuanian word ""lenktynių"" means ""vintage cars"" or ""classic cars."" The word ""entuziastai"" means ""enthusiasts."" The word ""rokeriai"" means ""rockers"" or ""people who listen to rock music."" The word ""visokių"" means ""high-class"" or ""elegant."" The word ""žmonių"" means ""people."""
"Yra ir tokių, kuriems tiesiog įdomus vintažas.",Some people are just into the vintage thing.,"There are also those for whom vintage is simply charming.

Note: In Lithuanian, ""vintažas"" specifically refers to the vintage style or something that is from the past and has a classic, retro, or old-fashioned appeal. The English word ""vintage"" can have a similar meaning, but it can also refer to the year or period in which wine or other alcoholic beverages were produced. In this context, I used the word ""vintage"" to convey the same meaning as in Lithuanian, but please be aware that the word might have slightly different connotations depending on the context."
"Daugelis motorolerių modifikuoti, todėl dviejų vienodų nėra.",Many of the scooters have been customised and no two are the same.,"Many motorcycles are modified, so there are not two that are the same."

Note: The Lithuanian word ""nariai"" can be translated as ""members"" or ""people"" depending on the context. In this case, I assumed it refers to people riding mopeds."

"Per savaitgalį pasitaikė gedimų, kai kuriuos motorolerius teko užvesti stumiant.",There were a few breakdowns and push starts over the weekend.,"During the week, there were incidents where some mopeds were stolen.

Note: The Lithuanian word ""gedimai"" means ""thefts"" in this context, but it is a plural form of the word ""gedimas"" which can also mean ""pine tree"". So, if you come across the word ""gedimai"" in a different context, it might mean ""pine trees"" and not ""thefts""."
"Ir nors Šiaurės Airijos orai ne visada tokie malonūs kaip „Lambretta“ tėvynės Italijos, šįkart Fermanos apygardoje važinėjantiems motoroleriams švietė saulė.","And while the weather in Northern Ireland isn't always as pleasant as the Lambretta's Italian home, the sun was shining as the scooters toured around County Fermanagh.","Even though the weather in Northern Europe is not always as pleasant as in Italy, the birthplace of ""Lambretta"", this time the sun was shining on the motorcyclists in the Fermanos group."
