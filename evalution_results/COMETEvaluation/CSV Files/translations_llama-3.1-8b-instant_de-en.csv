Jetzt nimmt sich das Weiße Haus von Trump die Freiheitsstatue vor,Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty,"The translation of the German text to English is:

""Now the White House under Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty for itself.""

However, a more accurate translation of the original text would be:

""Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty for itself.""

Or, in a more idiomatic translation:

""Now the Trump White House is taking the Statue of Liberty for itself.""

The original text is likely a commentary on the Trump administration's policies and how they are perceived as being in conflict with the values represented by the Statue of Liberty, which is a symbol of freedom and democracy."
"Das sicherste Zeichen eines Regime-Wechsels ist es, wenn sie beginnen, die Statuen zu attackieren.",The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.,"The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.

This translation aims to preserve the original meaning and tone of the German text. The phrase ""Regime-Wechsels"" translates to ""regime change"" in English, and ""Statuen"" translates to ""statues."" The verb ""attackieren"" is translated to ""attacking"" to convey the idea of a violent or aggressive action."
