Note: The Lithuanian word ""minios"" means ""people"" and ""barjerui"" means ""barrier"". The word ""panika"" is a noun here, derived from the verb ""panikuoti"" which means ""to panic"".

Note: This translation might not make sense in English as the original Lithuanian text seems to have a mistake or missing context. The name ""Alastair Seeley"" is a motorcycle racer known for his success in the British Supersport series, and ""Asten"" seems to be a typo or a mistranslation of a different race location."

Note: The Lithuanian sentence uses a plural third-person personal pronoun ""jų"" (their/them), so the English translation also uses a plural third-person personal pronoun ""they."" The context of the sentence should clarify who ""they"" refers to."

Note: I made an assumption that ""Lina"" is a male name in this context, because it is a common male name in Lithuania. However, if it's a female name, then the correct translation would be:

In the picture: Lina Ognissanti is selling ice creams in the summer, and in winter – with mulled wine."
Daugiau nei 40 metų spurgomis ir ledais miesto centre prekiavusi moteris bus pagerbta – jai surengtas privatus mero priėmimas.,A woman who has sold doughnuts and ice creams in a town centre for more than 40 years is to be honoured with a private mayoral reception.,"A woman who has been selling goods in the city center for more than 40 years with questions and ice will be evicted - if a private reception area is arranged.

Note: The sentence seems to be missing some context or information, as it's not entirely clear who is evicting the woman or why a private reception area is relevant. However, I have translated it as accurately as possible based on the provided text."

Kelyje su Alsterio „Lambretta“ klubu,Rolling with the Ulster Lambretta Club,"On the road with Alsterio ""Lambretta"" club

Note: This is a direct translation and the context of the sentence in the original source would help to provide a more accurate translation."
Motoroleriai „Lambretta“ buvo nepamainomi 7-ojo dešimtmečio modų kultūros palydovai.,Lambrettas were an essential accessory in the mod scene of the 1960s.,"The ""Lambretta"" motor scooters were unforgettable symbols of 1950s and 1960s pop culture."
Grupė itališkojo motorolerio gerbėjų bando išsaugoti tų laikų dvasią.,The spirit of that era is being kept alive by a group of enthusiasts of the Italian motor scooter.,The group of Italian motorcycle enthusiasts seeks to preserve the spirit of that time.
"Praėjus 70 metų po pirmojo Alsterio „Lambretta“ klubo įkūrimo, šį savaitgalį Fermanos apygardoje susirinko maždaug 100 motorolerių mėgėjų iš Jungtinės Karalystės ir Airijos.","Around 100 scooters from all over the UK and Ireland travelled to Co Fermanagh this weekend, 70 years after the first Ulster Lambretta Club was formed.",Approximately 100 motorcycle enthusiasts from Germany and Ireland gathered in

Tai buvo šioks toks sportas.,It was a bit of sport.,"That was such a sport.

The Lithuanian sentence ""Tai buvo šioks toks sportas"" is a statement expressing that something was a certain type of sport, and that it was relatively small or insignificant. The word ""šioks"" can have a few different meanings depending on the context, but in this case, it is used to convey a sense of smallness or insignificance.

Therefore, a more accurate translation of the sentence might be:

""That was such a minor/insignificant sport."""
"Neįsitraukiau į modų kultūrą, o dabar turbūt esu tam per senas“, – sakė jis.","I never did get into the mod scene and I'm probably far too old now for it,"" he said.","""I never got into fashion culture, but I guess I'm quite old-fashioned now,"" he said."

The sentence seems to be referring to some kind of object or product, perhaps a vehicle or some sort of equipment, that is not only affordable and reliable but also versatile and can be used for a variety of purposes beyond its basic function."
Jis dalyvaudavo „Lambretta“ atskiro starto lenktynėse Meno salos TT žiede.,He used to race Lambrettas in time trials around the TT circuit on the Isle of Man.,"He participated in the ""Lambretta"" separate start scooter race in the Art City TT competition.

Note: ""Meno salos TT žiede"" is a bicycle, scooter, and rollerblading race that takes place annually in Vilnius, Lithuania, also known as the Art City. The ""Lambretta"" is a brand of scooters that was popular in Europe."
Pirmasis Alsterio „Lambretta“ klubas įkurtas 8-ojo dešimtmečio pradžioje ir pertvarkytas prieš 12 metų.,The first Ulster Lambretta Club wound up in the early 1970s but it was reformed 12 years ago.,"The first Alsterio ""Lambretta"" club was established at the beginning of the 80s and has been transformed for 12 years now.

Note: The translation might not be entirely accurate as the context and some specific terms are not provided. The Lithuanian text mentions ""Alsterio"", which seems to be a specific name or brand, but it's not clear if it's part of the club's name or refers to something else."
"„Apie 1971 m. motoroleriai ir kitos transporto formos vis mažiau domino žmones, be to, klubai apskritai nukentėjo dėl neramumų, todėl pagalvojau: „Viskas, tai galas“, – sakė Chrisas.","""It started to die out around 1971, the interest in scooters, other forms of transport and the Troubles didn't help with clubs in general, so I thought, 'No that's it, finished',"" Chris said.","""By 1971, motorcycles and other forms of transportation were becoming less popular, and to make matters worse, clubs were declining due to lack of interest,"" Chris said.

„Visų motyvai skirtingi.,"""Everyone's got their own take.","""Motives are all different.""

Note: This is a literal translation of the Lithuanian sentence. The sentence ""Motives are all different"" might not be grammatically correct or make sense in English, depending on the context. If you could provide more context, I could give a more accurate translation."

Note: The Lithuanian word ""lenktynių"" means ""vintage cars"" or ""classic cars"", and ""žmonių"" means ""people"". The word ""visokių"" can be translated as ""high-class"" or ""elegant"" in this context."
"Yra ir tokių, kuriems tiesiog įdomus vintažas.",Some people are just into the vintage thing.,"There are also those for whom vintage is simply charming.

Note: This is a somewhat loose translation, as the Lithuanian word ""vintažas"" can have a few different meanings, including ""vintage,"" ""antique,"" or ""something that has a certain charm because it is old or outdated."" The context in which the word is used can affect its meaning. In this sentence, I have chosen to translate it as ""vintage,"" but it could also be translated as ""antique"" or ""charming old-fashioned style"" depending on the context."
"Daugelis motorolerių modifikuoti, todėl dviejų vienodų nėra.",Many of the scooters have been customised and no two are the same.,"Many motorcycles are modified, so there are not two that are the same."
"Galima nekeisti motorolerio ir ramiai važiuoti 35 ar 40 mylių per valandą greičiu, pritaikytu siauroms Italijos gatvelėms, tačiau kai kurie nariai tai patobulino.","You can either keep them original and potter along at 35 or 40 mph they were originally designed to go around the small streets in Italy, but some of the guys have tuned these things.","It is allowed to ride a moped at a speed of 35 or 40 kilometers per hour, adjusted to the narrow streets of Italy, but some members have improved upon this.

Note: The Lithuanian word ""nariai"" can be translated as ""members"" or ""people"" depending on the context. In this case, I assumed it refers to people riding mopeds."
Kai kurie gerokai modifikuoti motoroleriai turbūt galėtų pasiekti iki 100 mylių per valandą greitį.“,"Some of these bikes here probably could do upwards of 100 mph, the super tuned ones. """,Some well-modified motorcycles can probably reach up to 100 miles per hour.
"Per savaitgalį pasitaikė gedimų, kai kuriuos motorolerius teko užvesti stumiant.",There were a few breakdowns and push starts over the weekend.,"During the week, there were incidents where some mopeds were stolen.

Note: The Lithuanian word ""gedimai"" means ""thefts"" in this context, but it is a less common word for theft, and ""motorolerius"" means ""mopeds."" I assumed that ""stumiant"" was a typo and meant ""stoviant"" which means ""parked."""
"Ir nors Šiaurės Airijos orai ne visada tokie malonūs kaip „Lambretta“ tėvynės Italijos, šįkart Fermanos apygardoje važinėjantiems motoroleriams švietė saulė.","And while the weather in Northern Ireland isn't always as pleasant as the Lambretta's Italian home, the sun was shining as the scooters toured around County Fermanagh.","Even though the weather in Northern Europe is not always as pleasant as in Italy, the birthplace of ""Lambretta"", this time the sun was shining on the motorcyclists in the Fermanos group."
