From a visual map, the attitude towards Bitcoin in Eastern countries is more conservative compared to Western countries. The majority of global countries are still on the sidelines regarding the legal status of cryptocurrencies, indicating that the ""black swan risk"" remains significant.

From the transaction data of Bitcoin, although it has been legalized in some countries, there are still a considerable number of transactions taking place in the gray area, suggesting that the ""gray rhino risk"" still exists.

Note: I've translated ""黑天鹅风险"" (black swan risk) and ""灰犀牛风险"" (gray rhino risk) as they are terms used in financial and economic contexts to describe different types of risks. ""Black swan events"" typically refer to rare but highly impactful events, while ""gray rhino events"" refer to more common"

North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of Bitcoin, where green blocks (referring to the color used on blockchain) are most prevalent. However, attitudes toward this cryptocurrency are also becoming increasingly positive in Asian countries.

The current situation can be metaphorically described as the White House directing its gaze towards the Statue of Liberty, whereas the Statue of Liberty maintains a watchful eye on the White House. Trump's administration is currently focusing their attention on the Statue of Liberty, yet the statue seems to be keeping an eye on them in return.
It can also be interpreted that the Statue of Liberty is serving as a symbol of vigilance or a warning to the White House, suggesting a dynamic interplay between the two entities. Trump's actions and decisions are being observed by the Statue of Liberty, which may be seen as a form of public scrutiny or global oversight. The text conveys a sense of mutual observation and potential tension between the political power in the White House and the symbolic authority of the Statue of Liberty.

This translation conveys that the sculpture aims to symbolize the relationship between French and American republicanism using a timeless, classical analogy, with Liberty being personified in its female form. 

Note: The term ""Liberty"" (自由女神) refers to the Statue of Liberty, which is often considered a powerful symbol of both French and American values and ideals. This could be why it's used here as the central metaphor for the sculpture's meaning.

Lazarus changed its meaning: in her poetry, female figures are no longer abstract; she wants to speak. She views female figures as concrete and fleshed out, not merely symbolic or metaphorical. Lazarus creates female figures in her poetry, giving them a unique presence and dignity, rather than merely as a symbol or tool.
