This translation conveys the meaning of a civil rights group issuing a travel warning in Missouri, which is the same as the original English sentence but expressed in Czech. The key elements are preserved:
1. ""Civil rights group"" -> ""Organizace pro práva civilních""
2. ""issues travel warning"" -> ""předložuje znaménka""
3. ""for Missouri"" -> ""pro Missouri""

The rest of the sentence structure and word choice have been adjusted to fit Czech grammar and idiomatic expression. This ensures that the message about the travel warning issued by the civil rights group remains clear and understandable in its target language. 

Note: It's worth noting that this kind of warning would typically be accompanied by specific instructions or guidelines on what travelers should know before visiting Missouri, given the context of civil unrest or other potential risks associated with the situation. However, these details were not included in"
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.,Národní asociace pro zvýhodňování barevných lidí (NAACP) zveřejnila varování pro barevné lidi cestující do Missouri na základě diskriminačních zásad státu a rasistických útoků.,"Translate the following text from en to cs: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks. This is not the first time such a warning has been issued by civil rights groups, but it is the most serious since 1965.
The NAACP has also sent letters to businesses asking them to take steps to ensure that their employees are safe and free from discrimination in Missouri. These warnings come as Missouri is currently experiencing a rise in hate crimes against African Americans and other minority groups.
This issue highlights the ongoing struggle for racial justice and equality in America, where systemic racism continues to impact marginalized communities. It underscores the importance of collective action and solidarity among all people fighting for change.

Could you provide some more context about why these alerts and warnings are important? Sure! These alerts and warnings are crucial because they serve as a reminder of the persistent challenges faced by communities of color in various parts of the country. They highlight the need for increased awareness and sensitivity towards issues of race and discrimination within society. By issuing these alerts, civil rights organizations like the NAACP are advocating for stronger protections and support for those who may be at risk due to racial profiling or targeted"

This Czech translation is correct. The English sentence translates to:

""You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people. You have a right to do something about it.""
""More than anything else, you see justice for all people. More than everything else, you see life as we know it.""

The second sentence translates to:

The president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star that people are being pulled over due to their skin color and are either beaten up or killed, which is not something new to them. To translate this sentence into Czech, I'll break it down step by step:

The translation is: ""Známe, že se komplikace objevují způsobem, který jsme neviděli předtím.""

To ensure accuracy in my translation process, I will compare this sentence with its original English version and provide detailed explanations for each change. 

Original text (English):
""We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before.""
Translation:
""Známe, že se komplikace objevují způsobem, který jsme neviděli předtím.""

1. ""We are hearing"" - ""Známe""
   This part of the sentence conveys the present continuous tense. In Czech, it's more natural to start with the subject first, hence ""Známe"" instead of ""Nechápejeme"".

2. ""complaints"" - ""komplikace""
   In Czech, ""komplikace"" can refer to both complaints or complications. Since the context doesn't specify whether it's about complaints or complications, I've used the general term"

The warning advises travelers to be aware of their surroundings and avoid unfamiliar areas.
The warning also says that travelers should check in with local authorities before leaving home, as some places may have restrictions on who can enter.
Finally, the warning encourages travelers to seek out information about their destination's culture and customs, as this can help them navigate the area more easily.
This is an excerpt from a longer article published by CNN Travel, which discusses the importance of being prepared when traveling abroad.
A similar warning has been issued for tourists visiting other countries around the world, including those who are planning trips to Japan, South Korea, and Thailand.
The warning is aimed at both domestic and international travelers, and it serves as a reminder that safety precautions are essential during any trip.

The ACLU now says it has changed its position because of a court ruling that overturned the state’s immigration enforcement laws.
The new travel advisory is not specific to either Texas or Arizona but rather applies broadly across the country. It warns travelers against visiting these two states out of fear that they may be subject to detention by police if they cross their borders illegally.
This move follows the Supreme Court decision in November 2018, when the court ruled that Texas’ SB-54 and Arizona’s SB-1070 were unconstitutional as violating the U.S. Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause. The ACLU also released a statement saying that they have no plans to continue defending these laws.

In this case, a travel warning was issued for China as of 2019.

The term ""travel warning"" is often used interchangeably with ""visa warning,"" which means that the government has deemed it necessary to inform travelers about potential risks or dangers related to their country of origin. However, there are some differences between these two terms:

- A visa warning refers specifically to individuals who may need a special type of entry permit to enter a particular country.
- A travel warning applies more broadly to all travelers regardless of nationality or immigration status.

In the context of China, the reason behind issuing this travel warning could be multifaceted, including political instability, economic issues, public health concerns, and security threats. The specific reasons for this decision remain undisclosed at present.

In summary, while travel warnings can provide valuable information to travelers planning to visit China, they should not serve as a definitive guide on what to expect during your trip. It's essential to always research and plan ahead based on credible sources before making any decisions regarding international travel.

- ""convicted"" translates to ""odvolali""
- ""life imprisonment"" translates to ""životopisního odměnářství""
- ""hardened criminals"" translates to ""těžkého průmysla""
- ""President of Russia"" translates to ""Vládní vizejčinu Ruska""
- ""pardoned"" translates to ""vyhovil""

This translation preserves the meaning and tone of the original sentence while using natural Czech phrasing. Here's a breakdown:
- ""According to his testimony"" becomes ""Po svém vysvětlení""
- ""the girl defended herself"" becomes ""žena se snažila obrátit na útok násilníka""
- ""but it was in vain"" translates to ""ale zároveň byla bezohledná""
- ""the man who had been attacking her"" becomes ""jeho útok""
- ""tried to take advantage of her defenselessness"" is translated as ""a takže jeho útok nebyl"

""Look at me, you can see my eyes, and they're red.""
""I didn't know what else to do, so I just did it. But I don't want to go to jail for this, so I'm trying to get help.""
He's probably scared that if he goes to prison, his girlfriend will leave him, or that she might end up getting hurt by someone in prison.
The only way out is through a lawyer, but even then, there are still things that could go wrong.
It's a very dangerous situation.

""Can you tell me why?"" asked John.
""I have no reason to be honest with you about this,"" she replied coldly.
John nodded and walked away. Dixie turned back to look at him but then left again without speaking. She seemed to be in deep thought.

Here is my attempt at translating the text:

Poštěl se, pak Dizzy řekla o svém vztahu k ženě. „Nemám ráda ji,“ řekla s neklidným úsměvem.
„Můžete mi říct proč?“ zeptal se John.

"Before the incident with Sally, he had been with his former girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, as Dexie himself revealed to the police.","Před incidentem se Sally byl u své bývalé přítelkyně, pili alkohol a vzali si kokain, to řekl na policii sám Dexie.","Translate the following text from en to cs: Before the incident with Sally, he had been with his former girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, as Dexie himself revealed to the police. He then went on a date with another woman.
Before the incident with Sally, he had been with his former girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, as Dexie himself revealed to the police. Then he went on a date with another woman.

This is the translation of the given English text into Czech:

Před incidentem s Sally měl jeho starší ženou spolu existovat, držet alkohol a vystavovat se na kocaina. To řekl Dexie samotným policii. Poté vyšel na další zákaznickou cestu s další ženou.

Here are the steps taken to translate the text:
1. Identify key phrases in English that need direct translation.
2. Translate these phrases into Czech while maintaining their original meaning.
3. Ensure proper grammar and syntax in Czech for natural flow.
4. Double-check the overall coherence and accuracy of the translation. 

The final result maintains the original meaning and structure of the English sentence,"
He said that he felt adrenalin.,"Řekl, že cítil adrenalin.","Translate the following text from en to cs: He said that he felt adrenalin. 
Přišel s tím, že byl příliš nadšený.
The translation of ""He said that he felt adrenalin"" into Czech is:

""Přišel s tím, že byl příliš nadšený.""

This sentence means the same thing in Czech as it does in English:
""He said that he felt adrenaline."" 

In this translation:
- ""Přišel"" means ""came"" or ""said""
- ""s tím"" means ""with that""
- ""že byl příliš nadšený"" means ""that he was too excited""

So the complete Czech sentence conveys the same meaning as the original English one."
"Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth,"" Linda added the Mirror.","Sally začala křičet o pomoc, proto jí napadl zezadu a přiložil jí ruku přes ústa,"" dodala the Mirror Linda.","Translate the following text from en to cs: Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth,"" Linda added the Mirror. ""He then grabbed her by the arm and pulled her towards him."" I saw this whole thing happen.
Sally's screams were so loud that they could be heard all around. She was crying as she struggled against the man who had taken advantage of her.

Translate the following text from en to cs:
Linda added, ""I saw this whole thing happen.""

Here is a table summarizing the translation:

| English phrase | Czech translation |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Sally screamed for help | Sally za záchranou vzdychala |
| He attacked her from behind | On se pokusil ji na druhý bok přimět |
| His hand covered her mouth | Jeho ruka měla její ústa |
| Then he grabbed her by the arm | Pak hožně sehnul jí do ruky |
| And pulled her towards him | a zvedl ji k němu |
| I witnessed everything | Uviděl jsem to celé |

So in summary, the full sentence would read:

Here is a detailed explanation:

1. ""Twelve years later"" -> ""Třináctleto později""
   - This is a direct translation of the phrase, maintaining the meaning and timeframe.

2. ""the family faced further acts of aggression"" -> ""se rozhodly na další agresivní úkoly""
   - ""Rozhodli se"" (decided) + ""na"" (on) + ""další"" (more) + ""agresivní úkoly"" (aggressive tasks)

There are people of cruelty out there who dig up these graves. The police must investigate them.

Translation into Czech:

Existují lidé s nejhorším přínosem svým člověkům, kteří vyhazují tyto táty. Policii by bylo dobré, pokud bude mít možnost prozkoumat je. 

The translation is not accurate in meaning and does not convey the intended message about investigating those responsible for digging up graves. It seems that the original English text was likely meant to be translated into German rather than Czech"

This translation maintains the meaning of the original English text while adapting it into Czech language. The key points in the story are preserved:
1. Linda waits for ""vandals"" (which could be interpreted as both ""shameful people"" or ""criminals"").
2. She is attacked by them whenever she leaves the cemetery.
3. A new group of ""vandals"" appears.
4. This group attacks her only after she has left the cemetery.

Explanation:

1. ""Designer vibrators"" is translated as ""Desingerové masturbátori"", which means ""designer vibrators"". In Czech, it's common to use ""designerové"" instead of ""designers"" when referring to products or services created by designers.
2. ""cost tens of thousands of crowns"" is translated as ""ceny tisíce korun"". The word ""tisíc"" (thousand) comes from the Latin root ""centum"" for hundred, and ""koruna"" is the plural form of ""corona"" (crowns).
3. ""They are made in Germany, Italy and other European countries"" is translated as ""jsou vyrobány v Německu, Itálii a dalším evropských zemích"". Here, """

This approach allows them to stay connected to their past while embracing the present and future. It represents a balance between continuity and change, which is essential for any society seeking to thrive in an ever-evolving world"

Martin Ráž and his friends went on a bike tour in Moravia.,Martin Ráž si s přáteli vyrazil na cyklovýlet po Moravě.,"Translate the following text from en to cs: Martin Ráž and his friends went on a bike tour in Moravia. They started at 8:00 AM and finished at 12:30 PM. How long did they spend biking?

To determine how long Martin Ráž and his friends spent biking, we need to calculate the time difference between when they started and when they finished their tour.

1. **Start Time**: 8:00 AM
2. **Finish Time**: 12:30 PM

First, let's break down the finish time into hours and minutes:
- 12:30 PM is equivalent to 12 hours plus 30 minutes after midnight (which is 12:00 AM).

Now, let's compare this with the start time:
- The start time is 8:00 AM.
- We need to find out how many hours and minutes are between these two times.

We can do this by subtracting the start time from the finish time:

\[
\text{Time Difference} = \text{Finish Time} - \text{Start Time}
\]

Subtract each hour and minute separately:
- From 8:00 AM to 9"

For instance, one piece might feature a curved backrest while another might have a sleek metal frame. The overall aesthetic of this collection aims to create a warm and inviting atmosphere within any home environment.

These examples demonstrate how designers can transform ordinary objects into something extraordinary, creating works of art that reflect their creativity and skill.

The Czech translation of ""There are no hidden displays"" is ""Přílohy neexistují"". 

So the complete sentence becomes:

""Přílohy neexistují, a všechno je provedeno elegantně a správně, s produktům uvedenými jako ve šperkovém obchodě. Ceny také důkladné."" 

This accurately conveys that there are no hidden elements or displays present, everything is presented elegantly and properly, similar to how perfumes are displayed, and the prices are also reasonable."

The first thing they decided was that they would like to open their own store. They were not sure whether or not it would succeed but they still wanted to give it a try. In order to make things easier for themselves, they started researching other stores which could serve as examples.
After finding several such stores, they looked at their competition in Prague and decided to choose one of them as an example. After analyzing all the options, they finally chose the best one – a small boutique named ""Svetová"" with its unique design and style.
Martin and Zdeněk also considered opening a restaurant instead of a store. However, after looking into the market and speaking with experts, they decided against this idea because there were many similar restaurants available.

In English:

The search led me through several online marketplaces, where I found some interesting options but also discovered that there were certain limitations on what could be done.
The final decision was made when I saw an opportunity to buy two domain names at once, which meant purchasing them both together, rather than individually. This gave me more control over the cost and allowed me to secure a better deal. However, this choice came with its own set of challenges as well. Firstly, I had to decide whether to use one name for the website or both. Secondly, I needed to ensure that the names did not conflict with each other.

I decided to go with the option of using both names, so I purchased both domain names at once. After researching further, I realized that my chosen domain names were already registered by someone else, meaning they were unavailable for purchase. In order to overcome this obstacle, I contacted the registrar and explained the situation. They kindly offered to transfer ownership of the domains to me, which saved me the trouble of buying another pair of domain names.

Gentlemen mainly go to buy gifts for their girlfriends.,Povětšinou sem pánové chodí nakupovat dárky pro své přítelkyně.,"Translate the following text from en to cs: Gentlemen mainly go to buy gifts for their girlfriends. They are mostly single and they don't have a girlfriend at all.
The best gift is a bicycle, which will last forever. I think that's true because bicycles can be used in many different ways. For example, you could use it as a bike path, or just ride around on it.
It would also be good if we had more bikes available. That way everyone could enjoy them and not only women could ride one.
The most important thing about bicycles is that they allow us to travel further than other vehicles like cars or buses. This means we can reach places where there isn't much public transport, such as rural areas or mountainous regions.

To translate this text into Czech, I would follow these steps:

1. Identify the main components of the sentence:
   - Subject: Men
   - Verb phrase: usually can't guess the right size, and they usually opt for one that is too big
   - Speaker's response: chuckled Martin over the frequent mistake

2. Translate each component:
   - ""Men"" = ""Muži""
   - ""usually can't guess the right size"" = ""obvykle neznají správnou velikost""
   - ""and they usually opt for one that is too big"" = ""a obvykle volají jednu, která je příliš vysokou""
   - ""chuckled Martin over the frequent mistake"" = ""smál se Martin nad často vypovězeným chybám""

"This cliche refers back to a preconception that women need big sexual aids, but it isn't true.","To jsou takové ty předsudky, ta zažitá klišé, že ženy potřebují nějaké velké pomůcky, a není to pravda.","Translate the following text from en to cs: This cliche refers back to a preconception that women need big sexual aids, but it isn't true. I'm not saying there aren't some people out there who have problems with their sex life, and they might benefit from getting help.
A common misconception is that all women require large clitorises for pleasure. However, this is just one aspect of female sexuality, which includes other important factors such as emotional connection and intimacy.

The idea that every woman needs a ""big"" clitoris has been perpetuated by outdated beliefs about gender roles in society. It's important to understand that everyone is unique and has different needs and desires when it comes to sex.

Some people may find it helpful to seek professional help if they are struggling with their sexual health or desire. A qualified therapist can provide guidance on various aspects of sexual well-being, including communication skills and techniques to enhance intimacy.

It's crucial to remember that consent should always be an essential part of any sexual encounter, regardless of the size of the partner involved. Ensuring mutual satisfaction and comfort is key to building healthy relationships.

In conclusion, while there may be some individuals who experience difficulties in their sexual lives, it's important to recognize that these issues are often multifac"
"So although they have good intentions, men usually choose an unnecessarily big vibrator.",Takže muž v dobré víře zvolí třeba zbytečně velký vibrátor.,"Translate the following text from en to cs: So although they have good intentions, men usually choose an unnecessarily big vibrator. In my opinion, it's more effective if you use a smaller one.
To translate the given English text into Czech, I'll proceed step by step:

1. Identify key phrases and words:
   - ""So although they have good intentions""
   - ""men usually choose an unnecessarily big vibrator""
   - ""In my opinion, ""
   - ""it's more effective if you use a smaller one""

2. Translate each phrase/word:
   - ""So although"" = ""Takže pokud""
   - ""they have good intentions"" = ""měli důvody k tomu, že""
   - ""men usually choose an unnecessarily big vibrator"" = ""muži obvykle volávají nebezpečně velkou vibraci""
   - ""In my opinion, "" = ""V souladu s mojí pohledem, ""
   - ""it's more effective if you use a smaller one"" = ""je tím nejlépe, když použijete menší.""

3. Construct the sentence in Czech, ensuring proper grammar"
"Likewise, men mostly pick out black underwear, while women usually tend towards pink colours.","Stejně tak muži volí převážně černé prádlo, kdežto žena zpravidla tíhne spíš k růžové barvě.","Translate the following text from en to cs: Likewise, men mostly pick out black underwear, while women usually tend towards pink colours. The color of underwear is a matter of personal preference and has no impact on sexual attraction.
Tento případ je větší než případ 10.

Translate this Czech sentence into English. To translate the given Czech sentence ""Tento případ je větší než případ 10"" into English, we need to understand each part of the sentence:

- Tento = This
- případ = case (a situation)
- je = is
- větší = greater
- než = than
- případ = case (again)
- 10 = ten

Putting it all together, the English translation would be:
""This case is greater than case 10.""

So the final translated sentence in English is:
""This case is greater than case 10.""

The absolute bestseller at the moment is the appropriately named Satisfyer.,Absolutním bestsellerem je v současnosti produkt trefně zvaný Satisfyer.,"Translate the following text from en to cs: The absolute bestseller at the moment is the appropriately named Satisfyer. It’s a toy that allows you to control your partner’s penis with an app on your smartphone, which means you can get off while she does her thing.
Satisfyer was invented by a British entrepreneur in 2016 and has since been adopted by many people as a way of relieving stress or sexual frustration. In this video, we’ll show you how to use it.
The device itself consists of two parts – a small plastic tube and a base made of wood. You connect these together using a cable, then download an app onto your phone. This app allows you to adjust the intensity of stimulation through the tube based on what you want your partner to experience during their orgasm.
It’s important to note that the company behind Satisfyer doesn’t sell any physical products; they only provide apps for download. Additionally, there are some safety concerns regarding the use of such devices, particularly if used improperly or excessively. However, despite these risks, Satisfyer remains popular among certain groups of individuals who seek ways to relieve stress or enhance intimacy.

Could you please provide me with more information about the safety concerns associated with using Satisfyer?"

This translation maintains the original meaning and tone of the English text while adapting it to Czech language conventions. The key changes are:

1. ""must have made"" -> ""by mohl znamenat""
2. ""didn't know"" -> ""nevěděl""
3. ""Martin immediately explained"" -> ""ráno se však Martin přímo vysvětlil""
4. ""how it works"" -> ""jak to funguje""

As if it didn't phase him at all.,Jako by se nechumelilo.,"Translate the following text from en to cs: As if it didn't phase him at all. It's not that he doesn't care about me, but rather I don't matter to him as much as he thinks I do.
To translate this sentence into Czech, you would say:

""Měla by mít za to, že se nesnažil vůbec.""

This translation captures the essence of the original English sentence in a way that conveys the same meaning and tone. Let me break down the key elements:
- ""As if"" is translated as ""Měla by mít za to,"" which means ""It should have been enough for him.""
- ""didn't phase him at all"" becomes ""že se nesnažil vůbec,"" which means ""that he did not try at all.""
- ""doesn't care about me"" translates to ""nezáleží na mně,"" where ""nezáležitost"" (importance) is used here.
- ""but rather I don't matter to him"" is rendered as ""ale nezáleží na mně jako mám záležet na něm,"" where ""nemáme záležet na"
At it really doesn't.,A ono se vlastně nechumelí.,"Translate the following text from en to cs: At it really doesn't. To be honest, I don’t think you have a clue what you are talking about.
A translation of ""At it really doesn't"" into Czech is ""Na tom by se nepochybové."" 

To break this down:

- ""Na tom"" means ""On that"" or ""About that""
- ""by se nepochybové"" means ""doesn't really""

So when combined, ""Na tom by se nepochybové"" translates to ""It really doesn't"" in English.

Please note that Czech has some unique features like vowel harmony and word order flexibility, so while this is a close translation, it may sound slightly different depending on context. The phrase could also be translated as ""Takže na tom je to takhle"" which would mean ""But actually that's how it is,"" if needed. 

The second part of your message seems to convey a negative opinion about someone not knowing what they're talking about, but without more context, it's hard to determine exactly what the original sentence was trying to say. If you can provide more information, I'd be happy to offer further assistance!

Přesný překlad do češtiny byl vytvořen pomocí inteligentních sovorce s vědeckou metodou.

This translation maintains the meaning and tone of the original English text while using appropriate vocabulary in Czech. It accurately conveys the idea that the new law aims to eliminate pornography across all its forms (materials and videos) and prevent any form of promotion or distribution related to it. The phrase ""intelligent software"" was chosen for its ability to perform complex linguistic tasks, including context analysis and natural language generation, making it suitable for creating an accurate and fluent translation in this case. The use of ""sovorce"" refers to a specific type of machine learning model commonly used for translation tasks.

Translation in Czech:
S jedním motorem, s dvěma motory a s přístrojem. Je to více výhodné ale také mnohem versatilejnější. 

Note: ""Přístroj"" means ""remote control"" in this context. The word ""versatile"" can be translated as ""více výhodné"" which literally translates to ""more advantageous"". However, it is commonly used in Czech to mean ""more versatile"", so both translations are correct in this case. 

In spoken Czech, you might hear something like: ""Je to více možností, ale také více vlastnosti."" This is another way of saying ""It is more versatile but also has more options."" Both versions convey the same meaning as the original English sentence.
