Он предусматривает, что за каждый день, который заказчик не исполнит свою часть, в течение 10 дней после того, как он будет исполнен, он будет заплатить пошлистую сумму в размере 3000 рублей. Это ограничение влечет за собой серьезные последствия для заказчиков. Они будут вести себя более жестоко и снизить качество продукции. Вместо того чтобы исправлять ошибки заказчиков, они будут наказывать их за то, что они не исполнили свои обязательства. 

This law is designed to solve a serious problem of non-performance by the suppliers during government and municipal procurement contracts. It stipulates that for every day the supplier fails to fulfill its part of the contract, it will have to pay a higher penalty in the next 10 days, after which it will be fined 3000 rubles.

Sure, here's the translation of that text:

""Another two years ago, when entrepreneurs couldn't get paid for already executed government and municipal contracts, it was widespread. It was similar to having problems with cleaning up, but after resolving them, things went back to normal.""

I've kept the original structure and context as much as possible while ensuring the translation maintains the meaning and tone of the original text. The sentence is about a situation where people were struggling with unpaid contracts or cleanup issues due to previous problems. The phrase ""situation was under investigation"" adds an element of uncertainty or ambiguity which might be implied by this translation. However, without more context, I can't provide any additional details about what specific challenges or investigations were involved.

В результате она обнаружила, что в России есть масса случаев незаконного использования российских товаров, в том числе в сфере производства и потребления.

Then, on the same day, Putin ordered the General Prosecutor's Office of Russia to take a closer look at the problem. As a result, she discovered that there are many cases of illegal use of Russian goods in various fields, including production and consumption. Although these events occurred recently, this does not affect the current situation. Therefore, it is necessary to continue working on laws in Russia to improve the situation.

It maintains the core message that the issue was systemically pervasive across the entire country but was successfully addressed in a few cities. The phrase ""systematically"" is translated as ""systematically"" for clarity and precision in English.

However, according to data provided by prosecutors of Russian federal entities as of the first quarter of 2017, the total debt amount for state and municipal contracts listed by the supervising bodies of Russian federal entities amounted to approximately 27. 4 billion rubles.

The government in regions where the debt ratio continues to be high is working under a manual anti-crisis control mode. This not only helps in resolving problems but also prevents future ones. However, if this happens during an economic crisis, the government may have to stop its work due to potential conflict with legal institutions.

In summary, the government can take several measures to manage and reduce the debt burden of their regions:

1. Implementing strict regulations on financial transactions and credit limits
2. Encouraging local economies through investment and development projects 
3. Providing incentives for businesses to invest and grow
4. Creating a culture of responsible lending and repayment"

1. The General Prosecutor personally holds meetings.
2. These meetings involve local authorities representatives.
3. They examine unreported infractions.

It underscores the importance of addressing systemic issues and promoting inclusive policies that respect diversity and promote equality. 

Additionally, this warning serves as an example of how individuals can take action to support the cause of racial justice and promote positive change. By raising awareness about the challenges faced by color-conscious communities and advocating for fair treatment, we can contribute to creating a more equitable society.

"«Мы слышим жалобы часто, как никогда раньше».","""We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before.""","Translate the following text from ru to en: «Мы слышим жалобы часто, как никогда раньше». 

The English translation of ""Мы слышим жалобы часто, как никогда раньше"" is:

""We often hear complaints, as we did in previous times.""

This translation conveys that people are frequently reporting problems or issues they've encountered before. The use of ""всякою"" (we do) and ""как"" (as) suggests a repetition of past experiences, emphasizing how common it is for people to report their grievances. The phrase ""в предыдущие времена"" implies that this has always been the case and doesn't change over time. This sentence could be used in various contexts, such as expressing frustration about ongoing issues or reflecting on past experiences that have shaped one's perspective on life. 

In spoken language, this might sound more natural and impactful when spoken out loud compared to written translations. However, if you're using it in writing, an equivalent phrasing like ""We often hear complaints, as we did in our previous lives"" would also convey the same meaning but with slightly different wording. For example:
- In formal writing, it could read: ""We often hear complaints, as we did in"

They are not supposed to be restricted by anything that prevents them from traveling freely.

This is an important point for everyone who cares about freedom of movement, especially those who work or study abroad. It also has many practical applications, such as the fact that people do not need to worry about whether they have enough money for a holiday, because it is possible to save up for months ahead, or pay off debts quickly with a small amount of money. In addition, there are many countries where you can easily cross borders without any trouble, so people do not have to worry about crossing a border, even if they do not know their destination. People should be able to go wherever they want without having to make too much effort to get there. Freedom of movement means more than just"

One of the thieves was arrested, while the other managed to flee. 

This sentence indicates that there were two individuals involved in some form of crime, with one being apprehended and the other escaping.

It involves using different tactics depending on the nature of the crime, such as theft, fraud, or hacking, and it can vary greatly based on the specific circumstances of each case.

English To properly calm all of our citizens and tourists and inform them about this, he said that it would not be possible to have any relationship with a computer.

"Ранее президент России Владимир Путин подписал закон, предусматривающий право авиакомпаний исключать норму о бесплатном провозе багажа при невозвратном авиабилете.","Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law giving airline companies the right to eliminate the free baggage allowance rule on non-refundable airline tickets.","Translate the following text from ru to en: Ранее президент России Владимир Путин подписал закон, предусматривающий право авиакомпаний исключать норму о бесплатном провозе багажа при невозвратном авиабилете. Вместо этого правительство внесло изменения в закон, которые внесли бы в конец документа.

This is a text in Russian. Please translate it to English.
The text you provided is already in English, so no translation is necessary. It translates the Russian text as follows:

""Previously, President Vladimir Putin signed an ordinance that would allow airlines to exclude the ban on free carriage of baggage when refunding an air ticket. Instead, the government made changes to the law that would end the document."" 

This appears to be referring to a situation where there was a ban on free baggage transport for passengers who had refunded their tickets due to non-refundable flights. The changes were made by the government to address this issue. The phrase ""вместе с этого"" (with this) suggests that these changes are part of a larger set of actions taken by the government or officials at the time. The word ""конец"" (end) indicates that these changes"
"Речь идет о том, что авиакомпании могут сами определять количество мест и вес багажа, включенных в невозвратный тариф.",The point of the issue is that airline companies are free to determine the number of seats and weight of baggage at the non-refundable rate.,"Translate the following text from ru to en: Речь идет о том, что авиакомпании могут сами определять количество мест и вес багажа, включенных в невозвратный тариф. Это может быть полезно для тех, кто хочет сэкономить, но не хочет заплатить за все.

The text is in Russian and requires translation into English. Here's the English translation:

""Discussion is about airlines being able to determine how many passengers and their weight are included in the refundable tariff. This could be useful for those who want to save money but don't want to pay for everything."" 

This sentence suggests that there might be a system where airlines can tailor their services based on passenger numbers and weights, potentially helping people avoid paying full fees for certain activities or packages they may not need or enjoy.

Владимир Путин поручил ликвидировать загрязнения Байкала,Vladimir Putin has ordered the cleanup of pollution in Baikal,"Translate the following text from ru to en: Владимир Путин поручил ликвидировать загрязнения Байкала и уничтожить дикие животные. Это означает, что у нас есть возможность обсудить эти вопросы в общем собрании. Потому что наше правительство не может решать все проблемы без участия общества.

The text is in Russian and requires a translation from Russian to English. Here's the step-by-step process of translation:

1. Identify key terms:
   - Владимир Путин (Vladimir Putin)
   - загрязнение (pollution)
   - Байкало (Balkan)
   - дикие животные (wild animals)

2. Translate each term:
   - Владимир Путин = Vladimir Putin
   - загрязнение = pollution
   - Байкало = Balkans
   - дикие животные = wild animals

3. Construct the sentence in English, keeping the original meaning intact while using appropriate grammar and punctuation.
   
Here's the final translation:

""The President instructed to clean up the Balkans and destroy wild animals. This means that we have the opportunity to discuss these"
"Президент России Владимир Путин на совещании по вопросам защиты Байкала сообщил, что за последние годы значительные территории озера подверглись экстремальному загрязнению.","Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a meeting concerning the protection of Baikal, reported that, over the past several years, significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme contamination.","Translate the following text from ru to en: Президент России Владимир Путин на совещании по вопросам защиты Байкала сообщил, что за последние годы значительные территории озера подверглись экстремальному загрязнению. В результате этого утрачен 10% воды в бассейне.

English:
The President of Russia Vladimir Putin on a meeting about the protection of the Bay of Bengal stated that for the last years significant areas of the sea have been polluted with heavy metals. As a result this has lost 10 percent of water in the bay."
"Он поручил определить источники финансирования, планы и исполнителей для ликвидации загрязнения.","He instructed that sources of financing, plans, and those responsible for implementing the cleanup of the pollution be identified.","Translate the following text from ru to en: Он поручил определить источники финансирования, планы и исполнителей для ликвидации загрязнения. 他下令确定资金来源、计划和执行者以消除污染。

Does this translation mean that the source of funding is determined? Yes, the translation means that the source of funding is determined. The sentence states that ""He ordered"" (he instructed) someone else (the ""source"") to determine something. Therefore, the final answer is yes, it does mean that the source of funding is determined. 

The other options are incorrect because:
- ""He commanded"" doesn't fit as ""commanded"" in Russian.
- ""He decided on"" contradicts the idea of determining sources and plans.
- ""He appointed"" implies an official appointment rather than a command or instruction. 

So, all these phrases convey the same meaning - the source of funding was decided upon by someone else (likely a government agency or department). This decision was made through a directive or order issued by a higher authority."

А сейчас вообще всюду видеокамеры.,"Nowadays, the fact is, there are cameras everywhere.","Translate the following text from ru to en: А сейчас вообще всюду видеокамеры. Как это было бы в мире без интернета?

Now everywhere there are cameras. How would it be in a world without the internet?

The answer is simple - because we're all connected, so we can't tell if it's raining or not.

In fact, the Internet has been used for many purposes since its invention in 1960. For example, it was used to send messages and make calls. It also made it possible to share information and access the Internet.

It's now part of our lives, like an essential tool that helps us communicate with each other around the world. We use it to browse the web, search for information, connect with friends, etc.

However, there are some problems with the Internet today. The most obvious one is that people are using it for more than just communication. They use it to shop online, watch movies on their computers, play games on mobile devices, etc.

As a result, they have become addicted to the Internet. In addition, the amount of data they download and upload every day is too much, which makes it difficult to keep up with everything happening in the world.

The Internet also poses new threats. There"

Суд признал парня виновным в вандализме и приговорил к порке.,The court found the boy guilty of vandalism and he was sentenced to flogging.,"Translate the following text from ru to en: Суд признал парня виновным в вандализме и приговорил к порке.  The judge found the man guilty of drug dealing and sentenced him to prison.

English:

Sure, here is the translation:

""The judge found the man guilty of drug dealing and sentenced him to prison."" 

This sentence conveys that a judge has determined the man's guilt in relation to drug use, and he was convicted of such an offense. The punishment was described as ""prison,"" indicating it would be a term of imprisonment rather than a fixed period in jail. This is typical for sentences imposed by judges when determining whether someone should face legal consequences due to their actions or involvement with drugs. 

The original Russian text provided does not contain any specific legal terms or terminology that I can translate accurately into English without losing some nuance. If you have additional context about the case or details about what constitutes drug dealing or sentencing, please let me know! Otherwise, this translation captures the core meaning of the original statement. Let me know if there are other aspects you'd like to discuss regarding this sentence.

Чего?!,What?!,"Translate the following text from ru to en: Чего?! Какое? Why?
The translation of ""Чего?! Какое? Why?"" from Russian to English is:

""What?! What? How? Why?""

This phrase expresses confusion, curiosity, or a desire for explanation about something. It's often used in conversations where there's an unclear point or when someone wants to ask a question but doesn't know the answer right away.

In English, it could be translated as:
""What! What? How? Why?""
or
""What's that? How do you know? Why did you say that?""

Both versions convey the same meaning and tone of inquiry found in the original Russian text. The key elements are:

- The use of exclamation marks (!) at the beginning
- The repetition of ""what"" (what?! ) multiple times
- The emphasis on asking how/why questions
- The implication of seeking clarification

When speaking in English, this type of phrasing might be more common in casual conversation, especially if the context allows for some ambiguity about the meaning. In formal situations, such a question would typically require additional context or information to clarify its intended meaning. 

Note that while this translation captures the essence of the original question, it may not be appropriate"
Представьте себе.,Just imagine.,"Translate the following text from ru to en: Представьте себе. Внешне выглядит так, как будто вы сидите на вершине горы. Но, в реальности, вы находяесь в нижней части горы.

The text is already in English and doesn't need translation. It means: Imagine yourself. From the outside, it looks like you're standing on the peak of a mountain. But in reality, you are actually at the base of the mountain. 

This sentence describes a scenario where someone stands at the peak of a mountain but feels that they are still below it. The ""verne"" (peak) refers to the highest point of a mountain, while ""bottom"" refers to the lowest point. This metaphorical expression suggests a feeling of being elevated above one's surroundings when standing atop a high mountain.

"Как в Сингапуре сочетаются высочайший уровень жизни и неимоверно суровые законы, разбирался на месте обозреватель ""АиФ"".","AiF’s staff writer understood, right then and there, how exceptionally high living standards and unbelievably harsh laws go together in Singapore.","Translate the following text from ru to en: Как в Сингапуре сочетаются высочайший уровень жизни и неимоверно суровые законы, разбирался на месте обозреватель ""АиФ"". В Китае, напротив, есть очень развитая экономика, но она не всегда справедливо отражается в законодательстве. В Сингапуре, как в России, все нормы определяются местными правителями. В Китае, как в США, законодательство может быть неправильно или вредно для бизнеса.
The article is translated from Russian to English.

How do I combine high life standards with extremely harsh laws in Singapore? As an editor for ""Aisf"", I researched this on-site. In China, there are very developed economies, but they aren't always reflected accurately in the law. In Singapore, as in the United States, the norms of law are determined by local rulers.

"Здесь никто не думает отменять смертную казнь, - объясняет адвокат Виктор Ли Хонг.","Here, no one is concerned with abolishing the death penalty, explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.","Translate the following text from ru to en: Здесь никто не думает отменять смертную казнь, - объясняет адвокат Виктор Ли Хонг. ""Мы хотим оставить труп без суда, чтобы он мог вести себя как человек"". Он также говорит: ""Из-за этого мы не можем обсудить это дело с другими сторонами"". Это было сделано, чтобы подчеркнуть, что все стороны должны быть равными. Как это делается в реальности? Давайте посмотрим на примеры.

Вот пример из России:

""Признание смертной казни - это не только политическая позиция, но и моральный убеждение. Многие люди считают, что смерть - это незаконное приговор, и они хотят сохранить тело, которое они видели. Это потому, что они видят труп как часть их жизни, которая должна быть воспринята как человека.""

The government is now ignoring the opinion of the European Union and America on this issue.

The English translation would be:

""The government is now ignoring the opinion of the European Union and America on this issue."" 

This maintains the meaning and intent of the original Russian text while adapting it to natural English syntax. The word order has been slightly adjusted to sound more fluent in English but retains its core message about the government's stance on a particular matter being influenced by other countries' views. 

Note that ""представить"" (to present) is used here as an idiomatic expression for ""ignore"" or ""neglect,"" which is consistent with the context of discussing EU and US perspectives on a specific topic. 

In spoken language, you might also find variations like ""I don't care what they say"" or ""It doesn't matter what others think."" However, these are not as common in formal writing, so I've kept them out of this translation.

After that, drug couriers keep trying to get through our country. We know we have a huge potential for development. But there is another priority - to strengthen and consolidate our relationships with other countries.
This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Russian text into English while maintaining the tone and context. It captures the idea of persistent efforts by drug couriers to navigate their way through the country, emphasizing the importance of developing and strengthening existing connections with others. The phrase ""поддерживая"" (strengthening) is used instead of direct translation as it implies a proactive stance towards maintaining and enhancing ties rather than simply focusing on building new ones. This translation also preserves the overall structure and emphasis of the original text, which discusses the ongoing efforts of drug couriers to move forward in their journey across the country.
