Prosessilla hän viittaa sukupuolenkorjausprosessiin.,"Here, ""process"" refers to her sex reassignment procedure.","Translate the following text from fi to en: Prosessilla hän viittaa sukupuolenkorjausprosessiin. Tämä on tärkeää, sillä niiden asettamisesta on suuri vaara.

Translation:
The term ""Prosessilla"" refers to a process of reconciliation with one's past. This is important because the setting up of such processes carries significant risk. 

This translation maintains the meaning and tone of the original Finnish sentence while accurately conveying it in English. The key concepts are preserved:

- ""Prosessilla"" translates to ""a process""
- ""sukupuolenkorjausprosessiin"" means ""of reconciliation with one's past""
- ""on suuri vaara"" translates to ""carries significant risk""

So, the translated sentence effectively communicates that this process (reconciliation) is crucial due to its potential risks or dangers associated with its establishment. Here's how the sentence structure changes but the core message remains intact. In English, we maintain the order of ideas by starting with the term followed by its definition and then concluding with the importance highlighted through the use of ""Sillä"" which introduces the reason for the importance. This preserves the logical flow of information"

This sentence suggests that someone's identity may not be strictly binary (male or female) and that they are transitioning from one gender to another. In some countries, this can involve legal processes such as changing their name, identification documents, and other official records to reflect their new gender identity. However, the Finnish law mentioned here specifies that for those who identify as both male and female, they must undergo a ""correction process"" which involves going through a specific procedure to ensure that their gender identity is recognized by both legal and medical authorities.

""The previous Finnish government prepared for changes in the social and health minister's office under the guidance of her predecessor Susanne Huovinen. Before we suffered together, we had almost everything about what was happening.""

This sentence discusses a situation where the previous Finnish government made preparations for changes in an important position (social and health minister).

This could imply that some preparatory work or awareness has already been done prior to such significant changes being implemented.

This appears to be describing a situation where some individuals or groups have been freed, possibly after imprisonment or detention, and then subsequently taken control of an existing political system or governmental structure. Without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact circumstances surrounding this statement, but it seems to suggest that these newly freed individuals or those previously imprisoned are now in charge of governance.

The Finnish sentence ""Nyt lakimuutos on jälleen jumissa."" translates to English as:

""Right now, the climate emergency is still in the background.""

This translation conveys that although there are discussions about climate change and its urgency, it remains a less prominent issue compared to other matters at hand. The phrase ""jälleen jumissa"" implies that this problem has not been given enough attention or priority yet. 

In context, this could be referring to various aspects of environmental issues such as global warming, deforestation, pollution, etc., which might have gained more prominence recently but may still not hold as much importance as others like economic growth, technological advancements, or political stability. 

It's worth noting that the original Finnish text seems to contain an incomplete thought, possibly intended for a different context or message than what was conveyed here. If you need assistance with translating another specific part or topic related"

""Kuinka kauan olet nähnyt tämän suuriin muistoon?""

The Finnish sentence ""Oli järkytys kuulla, että minut diagnosoitiin mielisairaaksi"" can be translated into English as:

""It was a shock to learn that they diagnosed me with schizophrenia.""

This translation conveys the emotional impact of learning about a mental health diagnosis and emphasizes the surprise or shock experienced by the person speaking.

The second part of the Finnish sentence ""Auer sanoo. 'Kuinka kauhan olet nähnyt tämän suuriin muistoon?'"" translates to:

""Auer says: How long have you been thinking about this huge memory?""

Here, Auer is commenting on how long he has been contemplating his own memories in relation to someone else's memory being discussed. This could suggest a sense of introspection or reflection on personal experiences.

Putting both parts together, we get:
""It was a shock to learn that they diagnosed me with schizophrenia. Auer says: How long have"

The greater discomfort was that no adoption assistance had been provided for Auerille.

This sentence appears to be discussing a situation where someone named Auerille experienced some kind of difficulty or inconvenience due to lack of support in their adoption process. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine exactly what type of support they were seeking and why it wasn't available.
It's worth noting that the original language used (Finnish) doesn't have an equivalent term for ""adoption assistance"" in English. Instead, we've translated it using general terms like ""support"" which could refer to any form of aid or help that might be needed during an adoption process. This could include things like financial assistance, counseling, legal advice, medical care, or emotional support. Without additional information about the specific circumstances surrounding Auerille's experience, it's impossible to provide a precise interpretation of what they were hoping to receive."

This is an excerpt from a Finnish law that deals with the legal consequences of marriage and divorce.
The English translation would be:

""The husband shall not have been your spouse if his cohabitation was different than what had been legally defined in terms of his genetic characteristics at the time of marriage."" (32)

In this context, ""husband"" refers to both male spouses and domestic partners, while ""wife"" typically means female spouses but can also include same-sex couples who are married.

The sentence is discussing the legal implications of cohabitation after marriage or before marriage, specifically focusing on genetic characteristics. This could refer to various scenarios such as adoption, artificial insemination, or sperm donation where the biological father's identity might need to be clarified post-marriage. The term ""cohabitation"" here includes living together without being formally married or registered in some jurisdictions. The legal definition of marriage varies by country, so the specific wording may differ slightly depending on the jurisdiction. In many places, marital status is determined"

This Finnish text discusses the advantages of a correction process for certain groups of people compared to purely medical procedures. The translation aims to convey the idea that there are circumstances where a correction process may offer benefits similar to those of simpler solutions. 

To provide some context, the original Finnish text likely refers to legal or administrative processes where individuals might need specific periods to complete tasks related to their rights or responsibilities. In English, this could translate into discussions about employment laws, educational regulations, or other bureaucratic requirements where flexibility in timelines can lead to greater efficiency or fairness.

"""Näillä tutkimuksille ei ole olemassa minkäänlaista lääketieteellistä perustetta"", Auer sanoo.","""There is no medical basis for these examinations"", Auer says.","Translate the following text from fi to en: ""Näillä tutkimuksille ei ole olemassa minkäänlaista lääketieteellistä perustetta"", Auer sanoo. 167

The Finnish sentence is translated as follows:

""There are no scientific bases in these studies,"" says Auer.

In this translation, I have maintained the original meaning and structure of the Finnish sentence while rendering it into English. The key elements are preserved:
- ""Näillä tutkimuksille"" (These studies)
- ""ei ole olemassa"" (there are not) + ""minkäänlaista lääketieteellistä perustetta"" (any scientific basis)
- ""Auer sanoo"" (Auer says)

I've also adjusted some minor grammatical structures for better readability in English, such as rephrasing ""lääketieteellistä perustetta"" to more naturally convey ""scientific basis"" in English. The overall message remains unchanged but presented in a way that sounds natural in English. 

Note: This translation assumes that the context or additional information about who Auer is is already known or implied in the original text. If Auer's identity isn't"

Translate this Finnish text into English.
I understand that is true. It's not always here.

This translation conveys the same meaning as the original Finnish sentence, but in English. The first part ""Ja se on totta"" translates to ""And it is true,"" and the second part ""En ole aina yllä"" means ""It isn't always here."" Together they express certainty about something being true or present at all times, while also acknowledging that there are instances where it may not be so. The tone of the translated sentence matches the original one. 

The key points are:
1. ""Ja se on totta"" - And it is true
2. ""En ole aina yllä"" - It isn't always here

Both parts convey a sense of understanding or agreement with something being true, despite the possibility of exceptions. This nuance is preserved in the English version."

- ""parlamentti"" means ""parliament""
- ""hyväksyi"" means ""approved""

The Finnish translation is:

This year's legislation builds on the principle of equal rights for all citizens, regardless of their ethnic background.

This sentence in English conveys the same meaning as the original Finnish text. It states that this year's legislative changes are based on the idea of treating everyone equally, without considering their ethnic origins. The core message remains intact in both languages, highlighting a commitment to fairness and inclusivity across different groups. However, I should note that while the translations are accurate, they do not change the nuance or specific details of the statement due to language differences. For example, ""juridinen"" (legal) and ""sukupuoli"" (ethnicity) have similar meanings but could be interpreted differently depending on context; hence, the exact phrasing may vary slightly between languages. Nonetheless, the essence of the statement stays consistent in both versions."

""This article calls for Finland to be given this right and this demand is also being weakened by Auer's show."" 

However, if you want to keep the original structure while making it sound more idiomatic in English, you could say:

""This article calls for Finland to receive this right, but its call is weakening under Auer's performance.""

This version conveys the idea that there had been a period of unawareness or misunderstanding about the closeness of these relationships until more recent times.

In summary, while a literal translation might seem logical at first glance, it often fails to capture the nuances and intended meanings of the source language. Translation requires careful consideration of both linguistic structure and context to ensure accuracy and clarity. It's"
