Hnutí za občanská práva vydalo cestovní výstrahu pro Missouri,Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri,"Translate the following text from cs to en: Hnutí za občanská práva vydalo cestovní výstrahu pro Missouri City, Missouri.

English translation:

A legal challenge in Missouri City, Missouri was brought by the community. The court ruled that Missouri had not violated the constitutionally guaranteed right of free speech. This is because it was established as a constitutional right in the state's Constitution and the Supreme Court has upheld this right. The court also noted that Missouri's laws regulating the use of social media platforms were not in conflict with the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. However, there are still some issues that need to be addressed regarding the regulation of the use of social media on social media platforms.

The law enforcement agencies have been involved in investigations into the alleged violations of Missouri's regulations on social media use. They have conducted interviews with individuals who claim they have been subjected to social media abuse or harassment. These allegations have led to the establishment of a number of case files and legal proceedings against individuals who allegedly engaged in inappropriate behavior online. Additionally, the investigation has resulted in the arrest of several individuals for violating the laws of Missouri.

It is important to note that these cases may raise concerns about the privacy and security of citizens' communications on"
Národní asociace pro zvýhodňování barevných lidí (NAACP) zveřejnila varování pro barevné lidi cestující do Missouri na základě diskriminačních zásad státu a rasistických útoků.,The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.,"Translate the following text from cs to en: Národní asociace pro zvýhodňování barevných lidí (NAACP) zveřejnila varování pro barevné lidi cestující do Missouri na základě diskriminačních zásad státu a rasistických útoků. NAACP se rozhodne, že barevné lidé musí být však zahrnuty v oblasti pravidelného života a bezpečného výdaju.

The NAACP is calling for the separation of those who are protected by state and racial discrimination. NAACP believes that people with disabilities should be treated equally under the law.

The NAACP has called for the protection of human rights in the United States and the international community as well. They believe that the US Constitution guarantees these rights and that the UN Convention on Human Rights is an important source of law.

The NAACP calls for equal treatment of all Americans regardless of race or gender. They also support the right of women to vote and other rights for women.

The NAACP advocates for equality for people with disabilities, women,"
"„Cestovní doporučení NAACP pro stát Missouri, s účinností od 28. srpna 2017, vyzývá afroamerické cestující, návštěvníky a obyvatele Missouri, aby při cestování napříč státem dbali zvýšené pozornosti v důsledku série sporných rasově motivovaných incidentů, ke kterým v současné době dochází v celém státu,“ stojí v prohlášení asociace.","""The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein,"" the group's statement reads.","Translate the following text from cs to en: „Cestovní doporučení NAACP pro stát Missouri, s účinností od 28. srpna 2017, vyzývá afroamerické cestující, návštěvníky a obyvatele Missouri, aby při cestování napříč státem dbali zvýšené pozornosti v důsledku série sporných rasově motivovaných incidentů, ke kterým v současné době dochází v celém státu,“ stojí v prohlášení asociace.

"NAACP uvedlo, že k tomuto kroku přistoupilo na základě současných zákonů státu Missouri, které znesnadňují obhajobu rasisticky motivovaných činů před soudem, stejně jako v důsledku jednání orgánů činných v trestním řízení, které nepřiměřeně cílí na menšiny.","A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.","Translate the following text from cs to en: NAACP uvedlo, že k tomuto kroku přistoupilo na základě současných zákonů státu Missouri, které znesnadňují obhajobu rasisticky motivovaných činů před soudem, stejně jako v důsledku jednání orgánů činných v trestním řízení, které nepřiměřeně cílí na menšiny. 

NAACP is outraged at this moment because it has been caught in a situation where the state of Missouri has already imposed restrictions on racial discrimination based on premeditated actions motivated by racism, just as in a similar case involving another organization, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), which had its own rules and regulations against child trafficking.

The NAACP is also upset that the same pattern of behavior can be observed when they are involved in a legal dispute with another party. In both cases, the parties involved have violated their respective laws or regulations, but the NAACP argues that the same reasoning applies regardless of whether the law was established earlier or later.

„Dochází k porušování občanských práv.,"""You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.","Translate the following text from cs to en: „Dochází k porušování občanských práv.“

This is a direct translation of the given text from Czech to English.

The text translates to:

""However, it involves constitutional rights.""

or

""Nevertheless, it concerns constitutional rights."" 

Both translations convey the same meaning and accurately capture the essence of the original Czech sentence. The phrase ""porušování občanských práv"" (transliteration: ""Porušování občanských práv"") means ""ensuring or protecting citizens' rights"" in English. This implies that there are specific legal protections or guarantees for the rights of the people. The word order has been slightly adjusted in both versions, but the core message remains consistent."
"Lidé jsou zastavováni policisty jen kvůli barvě své pleti, jsou napadán nebo zabíjeni,“ uvedl pro Kansas City Star prezident NAACP pro Missouri Rod Chapel.","They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed,"" the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.","Translate the following text from cs to en: Lidé jsou zastavováni policisty jen kvůli barvě své pleti, jsou napadán nebo zabíjeni,“ uvedl pro Kansas City Star prezident NAACP pro Missouri Rod Chapel. “Načtěte na internetu o možném nástroji našeho představení a významné obvykle se rozumíme jako poskytnutí časopisu na Internetu, který je odmocnější než český přístup na Internet.“

English:
The police force is only targeted by their skin color, and are attacked or killed if they dare, “said NAACP president for Missouri Rod Chapel in Kansas City Star. ""Read online about our presentation and its significance as we understand that the most important thing is to have a website with us.""

This text translates the original Czech text into English, maintaining the core meaning while adapting it slightly for better understanding. The key points include:

1. Police officers are targeted solely due to their skin color.
2. If they dare to attack or kill, they face consequences."
„Hromadí se nám dosud největší množství stížností.“,"""We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before.""","Translate the following text from cs to en: „Hromadí se nám dosud největší množství stížností.“

English translation:

""Many of our complaints have been more severe than usual.""

This is a statement about an ongoing situation, likely referring to a dispute or conflict that has been ongoing for some time. The phrase ""many of our complaints"" indicates that there are multiple issues or problems that have arisen, and that they are not being addressed adequately.

The use of the word ""hromadí"" (roughly translated as ""severe"") suggests that these complaints are significant enough to warrant concern or attention. The fact that it's referred to as ""our complaints"" implies that this issue has been raised by someone within the organization or team involved in the dispute.

The phrase ""more severe than usual"" adds emphasis to the severity of the situation, suggesting that this particular complaint is particularly noteworthy or problematic compared to previous ones.

Overall, this sentence seems to be expressing frustration with how many complaints are coming through, especially given the nature of the situation. It might indicate that there may be underlying issues or conflicts at play that need to be addressed urgently. 

It's worth noting that without additional context,"

Here's my attempt at translating:

The incidents that the organization expressed were motivated by their desire to pursue students in the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanderse, who was killed by a man with the same name from Tennessee. This is the least impressive out of 1000 significant events.

Translation:

The text is in Czech and needs to be translated into English.

Translation:

Sanders died on the first day of the year due to unfortunate circumstances before he was struck by gasoline and police officers opened the door without any hesitation when they saw him suffering from a head injury. The result was a significant choice. 

This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Czech text while maintaining its tone and context. It describes the event in detail and highlights the significance of the decision made by the authorities in dealing with the injured individual's condition. The use of ""výsledek"" (result) and ""vyběh"" (choice) helps convey the idea that this was an important decision taken by those involved. The word order has been adjusted slightly for"

This is Czech and translates roughly to English as:

""My family has no hope at all after twelve years! I think that my own life is worth something. If I had the right to speak for myself and the reason why I am speaking, then I would be able to convince him of this.""

The speaker expresses their belief in the value of their own life and desire to make an impact on someone else's opinion or behavior. This is a common theme in many cultures, especially in Western societies where there is often a strong emphasis on individualism and personal responsibility. The speaker may also have a sense of purpose or identity that they want to share with others through their actions or words.
In this case, the speaker is likely expressing their desire to make a positive impact on others' lives or perceptions, rather than simply complaining about"

It provides an accurate description of how Sally Anne Bowman's life evolved over time due to various factors, including her income, presence, and circumstances that arose from the purchase of her property or services. The use of ""Zavražděnou"" (zavicious) instead of ""zavražděná"" (zavicious) maintains the sense of the word being used in a negative context rather than a positive one. Additionally, the phrase ""situace"" is translated to ""circumstances,"" which is more commonly used in English for this context.

I am not sure if this is in Czech or another language. Could you please provide more context or clarify which language it is? The text appears to be in Czech, and it translates to English as:

""Duchess was overcome with fear, she could no longer speak, but only in a whisper.""

This seems to describe a situation where a lady has been overwhelmed by fear and cannot continue speaking due to her inability to control her emotions. She may have been so scared that she couldn't even form words anymore. This kind of scenario can often lead to self-harm or other dangerous behaviors when emotions are out of control. It's important for people who are experiencing overwhelming fear to seek professional help immediately. They should also try to find ways to manage their anxiety or stress levels, such as through meditation, exercise, or talking to someone they trust. If the fear persists, it might be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor. Remember, it's okay to feel scared sometimes, but taking steps to"
Lewis jí měl ubodat na ulici.,Lewis supposedly stabbed her on the street.,"Translate the following text from cs to en: Lewis jí měl ubodat na ulici. I had to take him to the police station. I had to put him in jail.

English translation:

Lewis was arrested for assault. He had to go to the police station and be placed in jail. [Note: This is a fictional scene, not based on any real event.]

The English translation of the given text is:

""Lewis had to be arrested for assault. He had to go to the police station and be placed in jail.""

This sentence describes Lewis's situation where he has been charged with assaulting someone and must now undergo legal proceedings involving the police department. The person who needs to be taken to the police station (the ""I had to take him to the police station"") indicates that this is an action required by law or regulation, possibly related to criminal charges or public safety. Being placed in jail (the ""I had to be placed in jail"") signifies the legal consequence that follows these actions - imprisonment as punishment for his alleged offense.

In the context provided, it seems like Lewis might have committed some sort of violent crime, such as assault, which would necessitate legal intervention at a police station before proceeding further. This could happen in various scenarios,"

""Dixie"" is a character in the song ""Dixie"", a popular American pop rock song that was written and performed by Ray Charles in 1962.

""Ice"" is a short English phrase meaning ""the other one"".
""Rukom"" is an Old Germanic word meaning ""to look at"".
""Snažil pochopit"" means ""he/she tried to understand"".
""Její první pohled na ně"" means ""her first look at him"".
""Však"" means ""but"".
""Neslyšela rukom"" means ""she didn't see it"".
""Ale se snažil pochopit"" means"
Po přiznání Dixie mluvil o své nadrženosti a chuti po dívce.,"After he confessed, Dixie spoke of his desire and lust for the girl.","Translate the following text from cs to en: Po přiznání Dixie mluvil o své nadrženosti a chuti po dívce. A byl se s ní rozdělením věřit, že jeho původní hlas byl nesprávný.

I am speaking of my duties as well as about her, and I believe that his true voice was not correct.

The translation provided is in Czech and conveys the meaning of the original text in English. Here's a breakdown:

- ""Po přiznání"" = ""In reference to""

- ""mluvil o své nadrženosti"" = ""spoke on behalf of his duties""
- ""a chuti po dívce"" = ""and believed that it was wrong for him to speak""
- ""A byl se s ní rozdělením věřit"" = ""He believed that she was right""
- ""že jeho původní hlas byl nesprávný"" = ""that his original voice was incorrect""

"Na svobodě jsou tak krutí lidé, kteří tyto hroby vykopávají.",There are cruel people going around who dig up these graves.,"Translate the following text from cs to en: Na svobodě jsou tak krutí lidé, kteří tyto hroby vykopávají. 

This is a translation of the given text from Czech into English.

The Czech text translates as follows:

""Of course, these people are so harshly treated by those who take advantage of them.""

This statement suggests that the people being discussed have been subjected to extreme or unfair treatment due to their actions or circumstances. The use of ""krutí"" (hard) in this context implies that the individuals involved have been subjected to severe and unkind treatment. The phrase ""tyto hroby vykopávají"" directly translates to ""those who take advantage of them,"" indicating that the people at issue have been exploiting others for personal gain or benefit. This could be referring to situations such as exploitation in business dealings, social hierarchies, or any form of unequal treatment where one group has access to resources or opportunities that another lacks. The overall sentiment conveyed is one of derision or disdain towards those who exploit others without justification."

""Since our daughters are nowhere to be seen,"" she said to her daughter Linda, who was a nun. ""I'm sorry that I can't help you. We think it's the best course of action.""

And now I need to translate this into English.

Linda was waiting for her colleagues, but had to always wait after she left the conference room.

This translation is in Czech and conveys a similar meaning to the original English text about someone who waits for their colleagues while they are at a conference room. The key points that need attention in this translation include:

1. ""Linda"" (Linda) - This is the name of the person being referred to.
2. ""na útočníky čekala"" - This phrase means ""was waiting for her colleagues.""
3. ""ale museli vždy zaútočit"" - This translates to ""but had to always wait.""
4. ""tehdy, kdy odešla ze hřbitova"" - This part means ""after she left the conference room.""

The rest of the sentence structure remains largely unchanged as it maintains the same syntactical structure as the original Czech text. The word order has been adjusted slightly to sound more natural in English, but the core meaning and context remain intact."

3. I've kept the structure of the sentence as much as possible to preserve the original message.
4. I've used ""kolo"" (single) for ""a single thing"" as it's more commonly used than ""jedni"" (one).
5. I've used ""vyhlížejících vibrátorů"" (rotating magnifiers) instead of ""krabici plnou nevšedně vyhlížejících vibrátorů"" (plastic magnifiers with rotating magnifiers). This change reflects the fact that plastic magnifiers are now available on the market. However, if you're looking for a direct translation, both options would work well.

Jedná se také o designové předměty.,They are also designer items.,"Translate the following text from cs to en: Jedná se také o designové předměty. Design is not just a process of creating an object or product, but also about how to use it and how to present it visually.

The aim of design is to create something that can be used in many different situations and contexts. It is essential for us to understand the user's needs and preferences before designing anything. In addition, we should take into account the context in which the design will be presented and make sure that the visual elements are appropriate for the intended audience.

In order to effectively design, one must have a good understanding of both the technical aspects of the design and its practical applications. The designer should possess knowledge about the materials, tools, software, and other resources required for the project. Additionally, they should know about the latest trends and technologies in their field of expertise.

Ultimately, effective design requires a deep understanding of the user's needs, requirements, and expectations. By taking these factors into consideration, designers can create designs that meet the user's needs and expectations. This way, users can feel more comfortable using the product and experience satisfaction with the design.
Designing is not just about making objects or products; it involves understanding how to use them"

English translation:

The name of Intimity is also unique.

I'm not sure how to translate this, but it seems like it's referring to a specific or distinctive name for a company or organization that I don't recognize. Can you help me understand what the text means in English? The translation provided doesn't quite capture the full meaning of the original Czech text. In English, ""Jméno"" (name) and ""se zalíbilo oběma"" (it was also unique) are key elements that could be translated into ""Name"" and ""Also unique"", respectively. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly which part of the name or the phrase refers to. Could you provide any additional information about the name or the organization mentioned in the original text? That way, I might be able to offer a more accurate translation or explanation. If you have any other questions about the translation process or the content of the original text, please let me know! 😊✨

The Czech text translates to English as:

""Thanks to her, I've prepared it for Dagmar Stepanova, who studies FormaFatal. She says that she is not involved and that her work could be valuable.""

This translation maintains the meaning of the original Czech text while adapting it to natural English phrasing. The sentence structure has been slightly adjusted to sound more conversational in English. Note that ""FormaFatal"" is likely a brand name or product name, so it should be spelled out if necessary in the translation. 

For instance, ""Stefan's FormaFatal"" might be better translated as ""Stefan's FormaFatal,"" where Stefan is a person's name. If you have any specific details about the company or product, please let me know! Let me know if you'd like any further assistance with this translation task."

The translation of the given text from Czech to English is:

""We found it in 2013. The results depend on many factors, but each factor also multiplies by one.""

This sentence indicates that the authors discovered something in 2013, and that the outcomes are influenced by a multitude of factors. Each factor, however, has an impact multiplied by itself. This implies that there may be multiple variables or influences at play, and their combined effect can significantly influence the outcome. It suggests that the research findings could be complex and multifaceted, with varying impacts depending on the specific circumstances being considered.
The phrase ""prostor jsme našli"" translates directly into ""We found it,"" maintaining the original meaning and tone of the Czech text. The word order has been slightly adjusted for clarity in English, but the overall structure conveys the same idea as the original. The use of ""jsme našli"" (we found)"

This translation preserves the meaning of the original Czech text while adapting it to natural English syntax and idioms. The key points remain intact:
- The phrase ""nejdříve nám nepřipadal úplně ideální"" means ""Before we knew it"" or ""It wasn't perfect""
- ""že není na hlavní ulici"" translates to ""because it was on the main street""
- ""ale zase díky tomu"

Chtěli jsme být první.,We wanted to be the first.,"Translate the following text from cs to en: Chtěli jsme být první. Výhodou je, že jsme už ve vlastním prostředí a moheme se ovlivnit na svého závislosti.

The English translation of the given Czech text is:

""We wanted to be the first. The advantage is that we are already in our own territory and can absorb ourselves to our dependence.""

This sentence suggests that people want to become the first in their respective fields or industries, as they have already established themselves within their current environment. They see this as an opportunity to gain more control over their situation and make decisions based on their own needs rather than relying on external factors. This attitude reflects a desire for personal autonomy and independence, which is often associated with the concept of being the ""first mover"" or ""leader."" The phrase implies that success in one's field is viewed positively, indicating that pursuing it might lead to greater rewards and opportunities in the future. Overall, this statement highlights the importance of individual initiative and self-reliance in achieving success and gaining advantages in various contexts."

Bylo to nesmírně nějaký místní důvěru, že je to jako předpoklad, že by jsem se stal zbytek nejlepšímu kamarádem na těchto oblastech.

This is a translation of the provided text from Czech to English:

""Although I entered Intimity at 15 minutes past noon, the street was deserted."" It seems that this was something nonsensical that could have been interpreted as ""as if"" someone would become the best friend for these areas.

The original Czech text discusses an encounter or situation where someone (presumably a person named Intimity) enters an area called Intimity and finds it empty except for one person, which they perceive as nonsensical or unusual. This suggests that there might be some kind of misunderstanding or miscommunication between the person entering the area and the others who were previously present. The word ""nonsmoothly"" implies that the initial impression of emptiness may not necessarily indicate"

English translation:
Here I have no feeling that I would go on an errand with erotic material. That was a matter of personal trust which I learned in psychology. If it were not for me, I might have been offended.

This is an excerpt from a longer article about sex trafficking and domestic violence.
The author states:

The text in Czech is:

"I když je v obchodě pouze ženská obsluha, to aby se ženy neostýchaly požádat o pomoc, neznamená to, že by sem mužská noha nezavítala.","Even though only women work in the shop, so that women do not hesitate to ask for help, that doesn't mean that men can't step foot in it.","Translate the following text from cs to en: I když je v obchodě pouze ženská obsluha, to aby se ženy neostýchaly požádat o pomoc, neznamená to, že by sem mužská noha nezavítala. 

The text is in Czech and translates to English as follows:

If only a female shop assistant was present at the store, it would not mean that men were being ignored. 

This Czech proverb emphasizes that if there's just one female employee working at a store, it doesn't necessarily imply that all male employees are ignoring their customers or customers who might need assistance. It suggests that even if women aren't the main focus of attention, they could still be actively involved in providing support or assistance.

To break this down further:
- ""Jedna žena"" means ""one woman""
- ""požáda"" means ""request""
- ""pomoci"" means ""help""
- ""neostýchali"" means ""didn't ask""
- ""mužská noha"" means ""man""
- ""nabídky"" means ""requests""

So, while the original statement focuses on the importance of having a"

""Byla to jen čas nebo mnoho rukou."" 

This translates roughly to: ""I think it was just a chance or many fingers.""

The sentence structure has been slightly adjusted for natural English flow. The first part uses Czech syntax and phrasing while maintaining the meaning. The second part rephrases the initial"

This is a very important point that I want to emphasize in my speech. It's not about how we should be treated, but rather what kind of justice we need. If it's only for women, then this is just another way to justify inequality and discrimination. This is something that needs to change. 

It's not about the person who was convicted or punished. That doesn't matter. The issue is about whether we can have"

English translation:
So a man in a good suit could choose a very large vibrator. I am not convinced that such a large vibrator can be used to start a car. 

The original text is in Czech and translates to English as follows:

""So a man in a good suit could choose a very large vibrator. I am not convinced that such a large vibrator can be used to start a car.""

This Czech sentence discusses an option for someone with a suit who might select a larger vibrator. The speaker questions whether this type of vibrator would be suitable for starting a car. They are unsure if such a large vibrator could indeed be utilized to initiate a vehicle's engine. This Czech passage appears to be discussing the feasibility or suitability of using a large vibrator for starting a car compared to other options available. The speaker expresses doubt about its potential effectiveness in this context."

The text in Czech is:

""Similarly, men often say harsh words, while women tend to use softer language when speaking about red lipstick."" 

This translation preserves the meaning and tone of the original Czech sentence while adapting it to English syntax and idiomatic expressions. The phrase ""kdežto"" (whereas) indicates a contrast between male and female speech patterns, which are both used to express different attitudes towards something.

The translated text maintains the structure of the original sentence and conveys the idea that men typically use harsher or more direct language compared to women when discussing red lipstick. This translation effectively captures the essence of the Czech statement without losing its core message.

English translation:

The sentence structure has been changed for clarity and naturalness in English. Additionally, the term ""windmill"" has been replaced with ""revolutionary device"" which is more commonly used in English when referring to mechanical devices designed for energy production. 

In the original text, the word ""první"" (first) indicates that this is the earliest or most significant instance of such a device, implying that it predates any previous examples of similar designs.
The word ""způsobil"" (was powered) suggests that the device's power comes from the water source, indicating that it harnesses the force of flowing water to generate electricity. The phrase ""vibrátor"" (vibrator) implies that the device is an electrical generator, capable of converting the kinetic energy of moving water into electrical energy.

The company I work for offers me two positions in design: one in the graphic design department and another in the branding department.
