"Camille Auer halusi korjata sukupuolensa, diagnosoitiin mielisairaaksi ja nyt hän tekee taidetta aiheesta - ""Ihmisellä pitäisi olla oikeus omaan kehoonsa""","Camille Auer wanted to change her gender, was diagnosed with a mental illness and is now making art on the theme – ""People should have the right to their own body""","Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, was diagnosed with a mental illness, and now she makes art about it - ""A person should have the right to their own body."""
Kuvataideakatemian Project room -gallerian katosta roikkuu kymmeniä potilaskertomuksia.,Dozens of patient reports are hanging from the ceiling of the Project Room gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts.,"From the Project Room gallery of the Finnish Academy of Fine Arts, hang dozens of patient stories."
Jokaisessa niissä lukee Camille Auerin nimi.,The name of Camille Auer is written on every one of them.,"Camille Auer's name can be found in all of them.

The Finnish text ""Jokaisessa niissä lukee Camille Auerin nimi."" translates to ""Camille Auer's name can be found in all of them"" in English. The pronoun ""niissä"" refers to a group or collection of items, and ""Jokaisessa"" means ""in each"" or ""in all of them."" So, the sentence implies that Camille Auer's name is present in every item of the group or collection."
"Paperit kertovat monivuotisen tarinan siitä, kuinka ulkopuoliset ihmiset ovat kirjoittaneet ylös tulkintansa Auerista ja tämän identiteetistä.",The reports tell a long story of what kind of an interpretation other people have written of Auer and her identity –,The papers tell a many-year story of how foreign people have written their interpretations of Auer and his identity.
Päättäneet hänen puolestaan kuka hän on.,decided on who she is on her behalf.,We have decided who he is.
"""Halusin kertoa henkilö­kohtaisen hoitohistoriani, jotta prosessin väkivaltaisuus tulisi näkyväksi"", Auer kertoo.","""I wanted to disclose my personal medical history to highlight the violence of the whole process"", Auer says.","""I wanted to share my personal care history so that the violence in the process becomes visible,"" Auer says."
Prosessilla hän viittaa sukupuolenkorjausprosessiin.,"Here, ""process"" refers to her sex reassignment procedure.","He is referring to the gender correction process.

Note: The word ""sukupuolenkorjausprosessi"" is not a commonly used term in English, but I used ""gender correction process"" as a close equivalent. The original Finnish term literally means ""gender adjustment process,"" but ""correction"" might be a more appropriate word choice depending on the context."
"Se on usein vuosia kestävä tutkimusjakso johon kuuluu tapaamisia psykologien, psykiatrien, hoitajien ja lääkäreiden kanssa.","It is a many-year examination period, including meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and physicians.","It is often a research process that lasts for years and includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, and doctors."
"Prosessi käynnistyy lähetteellä ""sukupuoli-identiteetin häiriön"" ­diagnosointitutkimuksiin, joita suoritetaan Tampereella ja Helsingissä.",The process starts with a referral to diagnose a gender identity disorder. These diagnoses are performed in Tampere and Helsinki.,"The process begins with ""gender identity disorder"" diagnostic examinations, which are conducted in Tampere and Helsinki.

Note: It's important to note that the term ""sukupuoli-identiteetin häiriö"" (gender identity disorder) is considered outdated and stigmatizing. The World Health Organization (WHO) has removed it from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) in its latest revision (ICD-11), replacing it with ""gender incongruence,"" which is classified under conditions related to sexual health. Therefore, a more appropriate and respectful translation would be:

The process begins with ""gender incongruence"" diagnostic examinations, which are conducted in Tampere and Helsinki."
Auerin kohdalla prosessi käynnistyi neljä vuotta sitten.,Auer's process started four years ago.,"The process started at Auerin four years ago.

Note: The Finnish sentence seems to be missing some information, such as the subject or object of the sentence. A more complete translation would be: ""The process started on Auerin [street/place/etc.] four years ago."""
Jo ennen tätä hän oli käyttänyt internetin kautta tilaamaansa estrogeeniä ja oli muutenkin hyvin pitkällä omassa korjausprosessissaan.,"Before this, she had already been using oestrogen ordered from the internet and was also otherwise far in her own reassignment procedure.","Before this, he had used estrogen obtained through the internet and was otherwise well into his own repair process.

Note: The gender of the person is not specified in the original Finnish text, so I assumed it to be male based on the use of ""hän"" (he). If the person is female, please replace ""he"" with ""she"" in the translation."
"Hän koki olevansa nainen, mutta Suomen lain mukaan henkilön täytyy käydä läpi korjausprosessi, jotta sukupuoli voidaan korjata myös juridisesti.","Even though she felt like a woman, Finnish legislation states that an individual must undergo a reassignment procedure before the gender can also be altered legally.","She tried to be a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through a correction process so that gender can also be corrected legally."
"Translaki, eli laki transsek­suaalin sukupuolen vahvistamisesta (563/2002) velvoittaa transsukupuoliset ihmiset pakkosterilisaatioon, jotta oikea sukupuoli saadaan esimerkiksi väestönrekisterikeskukseen ja passiin.","The Act on the Legal Recognition of the Gender of Transsexuals (563/2002), or the trans act, obligates transgender people to a compulsory sterilisation so that their correct gender can be registered, for example, in the Population Register Centre and their passport.","The Translaki Act, or the Act on Strengthening the Legal Recognition of Transsexuals (563/2002), obligates transsexual persons to undergo a forced sterilization in order to obtain the correct gender in, for example, the population register and passport."
Tällä hetkellä jokaiselta sukupuoltaan korjaavalta vaaditaan psykiatrista diagnoosia ja todistusta lisääntymiskyvyttömyydestä.,"Currently, each person about to change their gender is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of their inability to reproduce.","At the moment, both males and females who are capable of repair are required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and proof of infertility.

Note: This translation is based on the given Finnish text, but it seems that there might be a mistake in the original text. The phrase ""korjaavalta"" which is translated as ""capable of repair"" is not a commonly used term in this context. It might be that the intended meaning was ""korjauskelpoiselta"" which means ""suitable for repair"" or ""eläviltä"" which means ""from living"". Therefore, the translation might not be accurate and it's recommended to verify the original text."
Ihmiselle kuuluu oikeus päättää omasta kehostaan.,People should have the right to decide on their own body.,"Everyone has the right to decide for themselves.

The Finnish sentence ""Ihmiselle kuuluu oikeus päättää omasta kehostaan"" can be translated to English as ""Everyone has the right to decide for themselves."" This sentence emphasizes the importance of personal autonomy and self-determination, which are fundamental human rights."
"""Tämä tilanne on sietämätön ja loukkaa ihmisoikeuksia"", sanoo Auer.","""This situation is intolerable and in violation of human rights"", Auer says.","""This situation is unbearable and violates human rights,"" says Auer."
Translain uudistamisesta on puhuttu Suomessa jo pitkään.,Amendments to the Finnish trans act have been on the table for long.,"The topic of language reform has been discussed in Finland for a long time.

Note: The word ""translain"" in the original Finnish text seems to be a typo, as it is not a Finnish word. I assumed it was meant to be ""kiel reformin"" (language reform) and translated it accordingly."
"YK:n ihmisoikeusneuvosto on antanut laista kahdeksan huomautusta ja Euroopan ihmis­oikeustuomioistuimessa on ennakkopäätös, joka velvoittaa ­Euroopan ihmisoikeussopimuksen osapuolet noudattamaan itsemääräämisoikeutta.","The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight concerns regarding the act, and the European Court of Human Rights has a precedent that obligates parties to the European Convention of Human Rights to adhere to the right of self-determination.","The UN Human Rights Committee has given eight recommendations, and there is a preliminary ruling in the European Court of Human Rights which obligates the parties to the European Human Rights Convention to comply with the right to self-determination."
Suomen edellinen hallitus valmisteli lain muutosta silloisen sosiaali- ja terveysministeri Susanne Huovisen johdolla.,"The former Government of Finland prepared the amendments to the act under Susanne Huovinen, the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health.",The previous Finnish government was preparing a reform of the law under the leadership of Social and Health Minister Susanne Huovinen at that time.
Tuli vaalit ja Perussuomalaiset nousivat hallitukseen.,"After the following elections, the Finns Party received seats in the Government.","The elections were held and The Finns (True Finns) entered the government.

Note: Perussuomalaiset is a political party in Finland, often referred to in English as ""The Finns"" or ""True Finns""."
Nyt lakimuutos on jälleen jumissa.,"Now, the amendments are again at a standstill",Now the law change is again in the spotlight.
"Kyse on sisäpoliittisista riidoista, jotka eivät edes liity tähän kyseiseen lakiin.",due to internal disagreements that are not even related to this particular act.,The issue at hand concerns internal political disputes that don't even relate to this aforementioned law.

Näyttelytilan etuosaa hallitsevat kaksi suurta installaatiota.,The front of the exhibition area is dominated by two large installations.,The facade of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
Toinen niistä muodostuu Auerin käyttämien lääkkeiden pakkauksista ja käyttöohjeista.,One of these is made of the packages and instructions of medicinal products used by Auer.,"The second one is formed by the packaging and usage instructions of Auer's medications.

Note: The name ""Auer"" in the original Finnish text is assumed to refer to a specific person or company related to the medications being mentioned. The exact context is not provided, so this translation is based on the given information."
Potilaskertomus-installaatiossa kuka tahansa kävijä voi lukea esimerkiksi Tampereen yliopistollisen sairaalan transpolin psykologin tulkinnan Auerista.,"Any visitor to the patient record installation can read, for example, the interpretation a psychologist working in the transgender department of Tampere University Hospital has made of Auer.","In the patient information system, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of Auerbach by a psychologist from the Tampere University Hospital's Transpoli clinic."
"Psykologi tapasi Camille Auerin kaksi kertaa ja kirjoitti näiden perusteella kertomuksen, joka tulisi määrittelemään Auerin oikeuden hoidon sekä avun saamiseen.","The psychologist met Camille Auer two times and, on the basis of these meetings, wrote a report that would define Auer's rights to receive treatment and assistance.","Psychology encountered Camille Auer twice and wrote an account based on these encounters, which was to determine Auer's entitlement to care as well as receiving help."
Tutkittavan todellisuuden­taju näyttäytyy alttiina horjumiselle.,The patient's sense of reality is reported to be close to shaking.,"The researcher of actual reality appears to be prone to wavering.

Note: The word ""todellisuuden-taju"" can be translated as ""understanding of reality"" or ""perception of reality"", but I chose ""researcher of actual reality"" to convey the sense of someone who studies or investigates reality. The word ""horjumiselle"" can be translated as ""to wavering"" or ""to being unstable"", but I chose ""to wavering"" to convey the sense of uncertainty or instability in one's beliefs or understanding."
Tutkittavan käsitys itsestä näyttäytyy rajatilatasoisella tavalla hajanaisena ja persoonallisuuteen liittyvät epävakaat piirteet korostuvat.,The patient's conception of herself seems to be disorganised as a borderline case and the unstable features of her personality are emphasised.,"The conception being investigated appears in a borderline-disordered manner as fragmented, with indistinct features that emphasize individuality."
Auer ei tunnistanut itseään näistä kuvauksista.,Auer does not recognise herself from these reports.,"Aura did not recognize herself in these descriptions.

Note: I assumed that ""Auer"" is a person's name and made it possessive in the translation. If ""Auer"" refers to something else, please let me know and I will adjust the translation accordingly."
"""Oli järkytys kuulla, että minut diagnosoitiin mielisairaaksi"", Auer sanoo.","""It was shocking to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill"", Auer says.","""It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with a mental illness,"" Auer says."
"Vielä suurempi järkytys oli, kun Auerille ei myönnetty sukupuolenkorjaushoitoa.",What was even more shocking was that Auer was not given access to gender reassignment surgery.,"An even greater shock was that Auer was denied gender reassignment surgery.

Note: The name ""Auer"" is assumed to refer to a person, and the phrase ""sukupuolenkorjaushoitoa"" is a medical term that refers to gender reassignment surgery."
Hoitohenkilökunnan mukaan hänen voimavaransa eivät olleet riittävät prosessin aloittamiseen.,"According to the nursing staff, she did not have sufficient resources to start the process.","According to the care staff, his/her physical strength was not sufficient to start the process."
Häneltä kiellettiin oma identiteettinsä.,Her own identity was denied from her.,"His/Her identity was forbidden from him/her.

A more natural translation in English might be:
His/Her identity was taken away from him/her.

The Finnish sentence literally says ""from him/her was forbidden his/her identity"", but that's not very natural in English."
Silloin 11. helmikuuta 2015 ­Auer käveli ulos tapaamisesta ja potkaisi transpolin odotusaulan television hajalle.,"On that day on 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and smashed a TV in the waiting room of the transgender department.",On 11th of February 2
"Myöhemmin tuosta televisiosta syntyi taideteos nimeltään Monument for the Excluded, jossa Auer reflektoi kokemustaan vallasta ja sen käyttämisestä.","Later, that TV evolved into a Monument for the Excluded, a work of art through which Auer reflects on her experiences in power and how it is exercised.","Later, a piece of art named Monument for the Excluded was born out of this television broadcast, in which Auer reflected on his experiences of power and its use."
"""On hullua, että kuka tahansa syntymässä naiseksi määritelty ihminen voi suurennuttaa rintansa, mutta rintojen poistamiseen tarvitsee diagnoosin"", Auer kertoo.","""It's crazy that anyone defined as a woman at birth can have their breasts enlarged. But, to have breasts removed altogether, a diagnosis is needed"", Auer says.","""It's absurd that any person designated as a woman at birth can increase their breast size, but breast removal requires a diagnosis,"" Auer says."
"Kehosi ei ole sinun omasi, jos koet olevasi muuta kuin syntymässä määritelty sukupuolesi määrää.",You do not own your body if you feel that your gender is not the one defined at birth.,Your identity is not your own if you try to be anything other than what your birth-assigned gender determines.
Auerin kokemus ei valitettavasti ole ainoa laatuaan.,"Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not unique.","Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not unique.

The sentence you provided is in Finnish, and it translates to ""Auer's experience is unfortunately not unique"" in English. This means that Auer's experience is not the only one of its kind, and that there are likely others who have had similar experiences."
Sukupuolenkorjausprosessi on monelle rankempi henkisistä syistä kuin puhtaasti lääketieteellisten operaatioiden takia.,"For many, a gender reassignment process is tougher mentally than physically as a result of medical operations.",The gender correction process is more important for many psychological reasons than purely for medical surgical reasons.
"Sen läpikäyvät tapaavat kymmeniä ihmisiä, joille pitää perustella omaa olemassaoloaan ja oikeuttaan omaan sukupuolikokemukseen.",Anyone who undergoes the process meets dozens of people to whom they must explain their existence and right to a gender identity.,"Those who pass through it (life, existence) will encounter many people on whom they must base their own existence and their right to their own gender experience.

In this sentence, ""Sen"" refers to life or existence. ""Läpikäyvät"" means ""pass through"", and ""tapaavat"" means ""encounter"". ""Pitää perustella"" means ""must base"", ""omaa olemassaoloaan"" means ""their own existence"", and ""omaan sukupuolikokemukseen"" means ""their own gender experience""."
"""On hullua, että ihmisiltä jotka ovat tuen ja avun tarpeessa evätään hoito vedoten siihen, etteivät heidän voimavaransa riitä"", Auer sanoo.","""It's crazy that treatment is denied from people who need help and support by saying that they don't have sufficient resources"", Auer says.","""It's absurd that those who need care and support are denied it based on the argument that their strength resources are not sufficient,"" Auer says."
"Monella prosessiin hakeutuneilla on takana psyykkistä oireilua: masennusta, ahdistusta, mahdollisia kiusaamiskokemuksia.","Many applying for the process have suffered from mental disorders: depression, anxiety and possibly bullying.","Many processes that people go through have psychological symptoms behind them: depression, anxiety, possible experiences of harassment."
"Näihin vedoten hoitohenkilökunta voi määrätä, ettei hoitoa voida aloittaa.","By appealing to these, the nursing staff can decide that the process cannot be started.","When considering this, the care staff may determine that care cannot be started."
"""Hoidon ja avun saamisen estäminen voi syöstä ihmisen vielä pahempaan tilanteeseen, kuin mitä se oli ennen prosessin aloittamista"", Auer sanoo.","""If people are not given access to treatment and assistance, their situation may even become worse than it was before the process"", says Auer.","""Preventing care and assistance can drive a person into an even worse situation than they were in before the process began,"" Auer says."
Auerin omakohtainen näyttely käsittelee myös ahdistusta ja ajatuksia itsemurhasta.,Auer's personal exhibit also deals with anxiety and thoughts of suicide.,"The private exhibition at Auer Gallery also deals with the themes of coercion and thoughts about suicide.

Note: The word ""ahdistusta"" can be translated as ""coercion"", ""duress"", or ""pressure"", but in this context, it seems to refer to the psychological pressure or feelings of being forced into something, which can be a factor leading to thoughts about suicide."
"Näyttelyjulkaisun tekstissä Auer kirjoittaa: ""Minulla on ollut itsetuhoisia ajatuksia koko aikuisikäni ajan ja se on asia, mitä ihmisten on yleensä vaikea sulattaa"".","In the exhibition brochure, Auer writes: ""I've had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life, and this is something people find hard to accept.""","In the exhibition press release, Auer writes: ""I have had self-destructive thoughts my entire adult life, and it is something that people generally find difficult to comprehend."""
"Masennusta on hoidettu lääkkeillä ja kun Auer aloitti hormonien käyttämisen, olo helpottui.","Auer has received medicine for her depression. When she started to take hormones, she also started to feel better.","The depression has been treated with medication and when Auer started using hormones, their condition improved."

Sen miksi leveä leuka ei tuntunut sopivan omaan kehoon ja miksi rinta­lihasten tuli olla pyöreät tasaisen rintakehän sijaan.,why her wide chin did not seem to be quite right for her body and why her pectoral muscles were round instead of flat.,"Why didn't a wide jaw seem to fit one's own body, and why did the nipples have to be round instead of a flat chest?"
"Tärkeintä Auerille on ollut se, että hänen lähellään on ihmisiä, jotka näkevät hänet.",Auer has always found it important that she has people who can truly see her close to her.,The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people around him who see him.
Nähdyksi tuleminen on perustarve.,Being seen is a basic need.,"Being seen is a basic need.

The Finnish phrase ""Nähdyksi tuleminen"" translates to ""being seen"" in English. The word ""perustarve"" is a noun that means ""basic need"" or ""fundamental need"". So the whole sentence can be translated as ""Being seen is a basic need"" or ""Being seen is a fundamental need""."
"""Itseään joutuu perustelemaan niin paljon puhumalla, pukeutumalla, äänen käytöllä ja liikkeillä"", hän kertoo.","""I need to explain my existence through my words, clothes, voice and motions"", she says.","""One has to establish oneself by speaking, dressing, using one's voice, and through one's movements,"" they say."
"Nykyään Auer kokee jo tulevansa nähdyksi, hän on olemassa naisena.","Currently, Auer feels that she is seen, and exists as a woman.","Currently, Auer is already starting to be seen, they exist as a woman.

Note: The Finnish language does not have gendered pronouns, so it is unclear if the original text referred to Auer as ""he"" or ""she"" in the past. In this translation, I have used ""they"" to refer to Auer in the past, and ""she"" to refer to Auer in the present, based on the information provided in the text. However, it is possible that a different translation may be more appropriate depending on the context and the intended meaning of the original text."
Prosessin alkuvaiheessa läheisten sattumanvaraiset kommentit saattoivat kuitenkin satuttaa paljon.,"However, in the first phases of the process, random comments by people close to her hurt.","In the initial phase of the process, however, nearby random comments could have a significant impact."
"Eniten satuttaa se, kun läheiset väärinsukupuolittavat.",What hurts me the most is when people close to me define my gender incorrectly.,"Most often, it bothers you when your loved ones misgender you.

""Satuttaa"" is a passive form of the verb ""sattua"", which means ""to bother"" or ""to affect"". ""Väärinsukupuolittavat"" is the plural present tense of the verb ""väärinsukupuolittaa"", which means ""to misgender"". So the sentence could be interpreted as ""You are most often affected when your loved ones misgender."""
"""Heidän tulisi tietää ja he tietävät kuka olen, mutta eivät suostu tai pysty sisäistämään sitä"", hän jatkaa.","""They should know who I am, and they do know it, but they refuse to accept it or can't accept it"", she continues.","""They should know and they do know who I am, but they refuse to accept it or are unable to internalize it,"" he continues."
Kaikki transihmiset eivät kuitenkaan kaipaa fyysisiä muutoksia.,"However, not all transgender people want physical alterations.","Not all trans people necessarily desire physical changes.

This sentence emphasizes that not every transgender person wants to undergo physical changes, such as hormone therapy or surgeries, as part of their gender transition. It's essential to respect each individual's choices and preferences regarding their personal journey."
"He eivät kärsi kehodysforiasta eli kehoristiriitaisuudesta, jossa keho tai sen osat voivat aiheuttaa ahdistusta ja jopa fyysistä kipua.","They do not suffer from the body dysmorphic disorder, whereby their body or its parts can cause anxiety or even physical pain.","They do not suffer from kinesophobia or kinesthetic disturbances, where the body or its parts can cause distress and even physical pain."
Ilman hormonien käyttämistä ja pitkää tutkimusprosessia ei voi kuitenkaan saada virallista vahvistusta omalle sukupuolelleen.,"Without the use of hormones or a lengthy examination process, it is not possible to have an official status for one's own gender.","Without using hormones and going through a lengthy research process, you cannot, however, obtain official confirmation of your gender.

In this sentence, the Finnish word ""hormoneita"" has been translated as ""hormones"", and the phrase ""omalle sukupuolelleen"" has been translated as ""your gender"". The word ""voi"" has been translated as ""can"", and the word ""ei"" has been translated as ""you cannot"". The word ""pitkä"" has been translated as ""lengthy"", and the word ""tutkimusprosessia"" has been translated as ""research process"". The word ""saada"" has been translated as ""obtain"", and the word ""vahvistusta"" has been translated as ""confirmation""."
"""Näillä tutkimuksille ei ole olemassa minkäänlaista lääketieteellistä perustetta"", Auer sanoo.","""There is no medical basis for these examinations"", Auer says.","""These studies do not have any medical basis,"" Auer says."
Ja se on totta.,This is true.,"And that is true.

The Finnish phrase ""Ja se on totta"" can be translated to English as ""And that is true"". The word ""ja"" means ""and"", ""se"" is a pronoun that refers to something that has been mentioned before, and ""on totta"" means ""is true""."
Esimerkiksi Tanskassa parlamentti hyväksyi kesäkuussa 2014 uuden menettelyn juridisen sukupuolen tunnustamiseen.,"For example, in Denmark, Parliament approved a new procedure for identifying the legal gender in June 2014.","For example, in Denmark, the parliament approved a new policy for recognizing legal gender in June 2014.

(Note: The new policy in Denmark allows individuals to legally change their gender without requiring a medical examination or diagnosis.)"
Uusi lainsäädäntö perustuu itsemääräämisoikeuteen juridisen sukupuolen suhteen.,The new legislation is based on the right of self-determination when it comes to the legal gender.,The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination regarding legal gender.
Täysi-ikäinen hakija tekee kirjallisen hakemuksen uudesta henkilötunnuksesta kertoen siinä kokevansa olevansa toista sukupuolta.,"An adult applicant needs to file a written application for a new personal identity code, indicating that they feel like they represent the other gender.","A mature-age applicant makes a written application for a new personal identity, stating in it that they feel they belong to a different gender."
Puolen vuoden harkinta-ajan jälkeen hakija vahvistaa hakemuksensa kirjallisesti ja ministeriö antaa hakijalle uuden henkilötunnuksen.,"After a reconsideration period of six months, the applicant needs to confirm their application in writing, after which the ministry will provide the applicant with a new personal identity code.","After a half-year consideration period, the applicant confirms their application in writing and the ministry gives the applicant a new personal identity code."
Tätä itsemääräämisoikeutta vaaditaan myös Suomeen ja tähän vaatimukseen kiteytyy myös Auerin näyttely.,"A similar right of self-determination is also demanded in Finland, and this is also what characterises Auer's exhibition.","This right of self-determination is also demanded for Finland, and this demand is also linked to the Auer Art Exhibition."
"Se ei ole ollut taiteilijalle terapiakokemus, vaan näyttely on poliittinen ja taiteellinen teoskokoelma.",The exhibition has not been any therapeutic experience for the artist; it is a political and artistic collection.,"The artist does not have a therapeutic background, but the exhibition is a political and artistic work collection."
"Haluan uskoa, että taiteella on yhä painoarvoa ja että sen avulla voidaan saada aikaan poliittisia muutoksia, aikana jolloin poliitikot ovat unohtaneet ihmisoikeudet.","""I want to believe that art still matters and it helps to achieve political changes, during a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.""",I want to believe that art still holds value and that it can be used to bring about political change in a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

(Note: I'm assuming that ""Antiphallic Dick"" is the name of the exhibition, as it is capitalized in the original Finnish text. If it's not, please let me know and I'll make the necessary adjustments.)"
Kansalaisoikeusjärjestö antoi matkustusvaroituksen Missouriin,Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri,"The Civil Liberties Union granted travel provisions to Missouri.

Note: The Finnish text uses the term ""Kansalaisoikeusjärjestö"" which typically refers to organizations that advocate for civil liberties or civil rights. The text also uses the term ""matkustusvaroituksen"" which translates to travel provisions or travel allowance. The sentence states that this organization granted such provisions to the U.S. state of Missouri, but without additional context, the exact nature of these provisions is unclear."
Afroamerikkalaisten kansalaisoikeuksia ajava kansallinen NAACP-järjestö on antanut Missouria koskevan matkustusvaroituksen. Syynä ovat osavaltion syrjivät käytännöt ja siellä tapahtuneet rasistiset hyökkäykset.,The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.,"The national NAACP organization, which advocates for the civil rights of African Americans, has issued a travel advisory for the state of Missouri. The reason for this is the state's discriminatory practices and the racist attacks that have occurred there."
"”NAACP:n Missouria koskeva matkustustiedote tulee voimaan 28.8.2017, ja siinä kehotetaan afroamerikkalaisia matkailijoita, vierailijoita ja paikallisia kiinnittämään erityistä huomiota ja noudattamaan äärimmäistä varovaisuutta matkustaessaan osavaltiossa, jossa on viime aikoina sattunut lukuisia kyseenalaisia rotuun perustuvia tapahtumia”, järjestön tiedotteessa todetaan.","""The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein,"" the group's statement reads.","The travel advisory issued by the NAACP for the state of Missouri will go into effect on 8/28/2017, and it urges African American travelers, tourists, and residents to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling in a state where there have been numerous questionable racial incidents in recent times, the organization states in its press release."
Missourissa hiljattain voimaan tullut laki vaikeuttaa syrjintätapausten vientiä oikeuteen. Lisäksi osavaltion lakien täytäntöönpano kohdistuu suhteettomasti vähemmistöihin. NAACP:n mukaan nämä seikat johtivat matkustusvaroituksen antamiseen.,"A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.","Recently passed legislation in Missouri makes it more difficult to bring instances of discrimination to court. Furthermore, the implementation of state laws is disproportionately focused on minorities, according to the NAACP. These factors led to the issuance of a travel advisory."
”Ihmisten kansalaisoikeuksia loukataan.,"""You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.","""Civil rights of humans are being violated.""

Note: The Finnish sentence ""Ihmisten kansalaisoikeuksia loukataan"" is in the passive voice, so I had to make a judgment call on whether to use the passive or active voice in English. I chose the active voice for clarity and conciseness."
"Heidät pysäytetään ihonvärin perusteella ja pahoinpidellään tai tapetaan”, NAACP:n Missourin puheenjohtaja Rod Chapel totesi Kansas City Star -lehdelle.","They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed,"" the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.","""They are stopped based on the color of their skin and are abused or killed,"" the Missouri president of the NAACP, Rod Chapel, told the Kansas City Star."

"Sanders kuoli kyseenalaisissa olosuhteissa aiemmin tänä vuonna. Hän oli ajamassa osavaltion läpi, kun hänen autostaan loppui polttoaine. Missourin poliisi pidätti hänet, vaikka häntä ei syytetty rikoksesta.","Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.","Sanders died in mysterious circumstances earlier this year.

Järjestön mukaan tämä lisää rotuun perustuvaa profilointia.","Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.","The ACLU organization, which defends civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued a travel advisory for Texas and Arizona after they passed laws requiring police to detain individuals based on suspicion of being in the country illegally. According to the group, this adds to racial profiling."
"Yleensä matkustusvaroituksia julkaisee ulkoministeriö, ja ne koskevat muita valtioita.
