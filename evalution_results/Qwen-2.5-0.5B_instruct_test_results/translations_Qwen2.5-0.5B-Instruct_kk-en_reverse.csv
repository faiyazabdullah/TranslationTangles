"Given the clear benefits of nimble monetary policy, central bankers need to open their eyes to the possibilities that flexibility affords.",Епті ақша-несие саясатының жақсы жақтарын ескере келе орталық банктер бейімделгіштікке де мән бере бастауы қажет.,"Translate the following text from en to kk: Given the clear benefits of nimble monetary policy, central bankers need to open their eyes to the possibilities that flexibility affords. In this article, we will discuss how flexible monetary policy can be used as a tool for inflation targeting and also provide some insights into the role that it plays in the process of achieving monetary stability.
Nimble monetary policy allows central banks to adjust interest rates on short-term bonds with greater frequency than they would if they were dealing with long-term debt. This is because, in practice, most of the money created by central banks is spent quickly and does not last very long. As a result, central banks have to use their discretion when deciding whether to increase or decrease interest rates. However, there are many ways to improve the efficiency of such decisions, including using market information, adjusting the supply of reserves, and changing the cost of borrowing.

In addition to the above mentioned benefits, flexible monetary policy can also help to reduce risks associated with central bank operations. Central banks may face liquidity constraints due to changes in demand for currency, which can lead to an increase in exchange rate volatility. On the other hand, by allowing central banks to change interest rates more frequently, they can reduce the risk of sudden changes in exchange"
"The rule of thumb for monetary policymakers has long been that if inflation is below official target ranges, short-term interest rates should be set at a level that spurs spending and investment.","Ақша-несие саясатын жасаушылардың қалыптасқан дәстүрі – егер инфляция ресми болжалған диапазоннан көп уақыт төмен тұрса, қысқа мерзімді пайыздық үстемелер шығындар мен инвестицияға серпін беретіндей деңгейде белгіленуі керек.","Translate the following text from en to kk: The rule of thumb for monetary policymakers has long been that if inflation is below official target ranges, short-term interest rates should be set at a level that spurs spending and investment. If inflation is above target levels, then policy makers should lower their short-term interest rates. This approach is known as the “stick-and-stick” strategy. It involves keeping interest rates high in order to slow down economic growth and reduce unemployment.
The stick-and-stick strategy is also known as the “stick and slide” or “slippery slope.” It’s an idea that many economists believe will lead to higher inflation and greater economic instability over time. In 2018, the US Federal Reserve announced its intention to raise interest rates by $50 billion, which would have a significant impact on the economy. The central bank believes that raising interest rates will cause the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers to increase, leading to higher prices and slower economic growth.
Therefore, it is not advisable to use this strategy when trying to achieve inflation targets. Instead, policymakers should aim to keep inflation within a specific range and consider other factors such as the overall health of the economy, fiscal policies, and trade relations. By doing so, they can"
"This approach has meant that once interest rates reach or approach zero, central banks have little choice but to activate large asset-purchase programs that are supposed to stimulate demand.",Бұл тәсілдің ерекшелігі – пайыздық үстемелер нөлге жақындағанда орталық банктердің сұранысты арттыру үшін активтерді сатып алу бағдарламаларын іске қосудан басқа амалы қалмайды.,"Translate the following text from en to kk: This approach has meant that once interest rates reach or approach zero, central banks have little choice but to activate large asset-purchase programs that are supposed to stimulate demand. However, this approach is not sustainable as it does not allow for a gradual increase in economic activity.

This approach has also resulted in the creation of bubbles and financial crises due to excessive leverage on the part of the banks. The problem with the idea of raising interest rates is that it may lead to inflation, which could cause a recession if left unchecked.

The solution proposed by some economists is to lower interest rates, which would reduce the amount of money available for lending. This would result in an expansionary monetary policy, which would be more conducive to growth than lowering interest rates.

In conclusion, although the use of low-interest-rate policies seems attractive at first glance, it can actually have negative consequences. Therefore, policymakers must carefully consider the long-term implications of their actions and take necessary measures to avoid potential crises.

"When circumstances call for it, policymakers default to the predetermined scripts of neo-Keynesian economic models.","Егер жағдай соған жетсе, саяси шешім қабылдаушылар жаңа Кейнс экономикалық моделі негізіндегі белгілі сценарийлер бойынша дефолт жариялайды.","Translate the following text from en to kk: When circumstances call for it, policymakers default to the predetermined scripts of neo-Keynesian economic models. This is a phenomenon that I will refer to as ""neo-Keplerian"" because these models are often referred to as ""Keplerian"" in English.

When there is no chance of change and stability, the model assumes an equilibrium state of the economy. The model assumes that there exists a set of equations describing how the economy works. These equations describe all possible states of the economy and how they can be transformed into each other by the process of adjustment. For example, if the supply of goods decreases while demand increases, then the price of those goods would rise.

The model also takes into account the effects of external factors on the economy. For instance, if a country imports more than it exports, then its currency value would depreciate. Similarly, if a country exports less than it imports, its currency value would appreciate. Additionally, changes in government policies or monetary policy could have an effect on the exchange rate between different currencies.

In this context, we need to understand the concept of equilibrium. An equilibrium occurs when the quantity of a good supplied equals the quantity demanded at any given price level. It represents the point where the"

"For starters, households have not responded to ultra-low interest rates by saving less and spending more.","Біріншіден, отбасылар пайыздық үстеме тым төмен болса да, ақшаны аз сақтап, көп жұмсаған жоқ.","Translate the following text from en to kk: For starters, households have not responded to ultra-low interest rates by saving less and spending more. Instead, they are using their savings for consumption.

For example, in a recent survey conducted by the Bank of England, 40% of respondents said that they had saved money in an account that was at or below zero dollars, with only 38% saying that they had saved money in accounts above this level. This shows how much people are willing to save for future use, but not necessarily for today's purchases.

In addition, according to a study by the University of Cambridge, it is estimated that one out of every three adults has a credit card debt of over £500 per month. Many people do not realize that they can pay off their debts through tax relief, which means that paying off these debts will reduce their monthly expenses and thus free up some money for other uses.

Therefore, if we want to reduce the amount of debt that people carry, then it would be beneficial to encourage them to save more money rather than borrowing more money.

In conclusion, saving money does not necessarily mean that you are saving your money for tomorrow. Rather, it is about being prepared for the present, and the better you prepare"

If you want to start a business in Korea, there are several things you should consider before you get started. The first thing you should do is find out if there is any government support program for starting a business. In Korea, businesses have been encouraged by the government to be able to offer incentives to new entrepreneurs. You can learn about these programs on the Korean government’s website or by contacting your local government office.

The second thing you should consider when setting up a business is what type of financing you will use. There are many types of financing options available such as loans, grants, and equity investments. Each option has different advantages and disadvantages, so it is important to research each one thoroughly before making a decision.

The third thing you should consider is whether you plan to operate a foreign company or not. In Korea, operating a foreign company requires special permission from the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MOTI). To obtain this permission,"

"It’s easy to see why, despite the data, predetermined formulas are attractive to monetary policymakers.

The prevailing wisdom holds that in order to return the inflation rate to a preferred level, any slack in the economy must be eliminated. This is because if we have excess reserves, then we can easily manipulate the money supply to achieve this goal. Thus, it seems like an obvious and simple solution.

However, when I look at the data on inflation rates for different countries, I find that most of them do not follow this logic. In fact, some countries are experiencing high inflation, while others are experiencing low inflation. In addition, many countries also face problems with unemployment or underemployment, which makes it difficult for people to find jobs or make ends meet. These factors lead me to believe that the reason behind the current economic situation is not so much about monetary policies but rather more about structural issues within the country's economy. In other words, there may be structural problems such as a lack of demand, overproduction, or inefficient allocation of resources.

In my opinion, these structural issues should be addressed by government intervention, especially through fiscal policy. Fiscal policy involves changing taxes and spending levels, which will help stimulate aggregate demand and reduce inflationary pressures"

The central tendency and dispersion of returns were not related to each other. This meant that it was impossible to predict the future value of a portfolio with any certainty.

The key idea here is that there is no relationship between the central tendency (average) and the dispersion (spread) of returns in the stock market or any other market. In contrast, the central tendency and the dispersion are closely related to one another in the case of a single asset. For example, if an asset has a high return but also a low standard deviation, then the average will be high and the spread will be low.

Therefore, we can say that the correlation coefficient between two assets is determined by their individual characteristics and not by their mutual relationship. This means that the correlation coefficient does not change regardless of whether they are positively correlated or negatively correlated, because both depend on their individual characteristics.

In summary, the correlation coefficient between two assets is determined solely by their individual characteristics, and it does not depend on their mutual relationship.

Bangladesh Police Chief Hameedul Alam said he believes Haque was a drug dealer who died in an exchange of gunfire, but that the officers involved did not kill him and then planted drugs at the scene. He also stated that the officers' testimony is unreliable because they have no evidence or documentation to support their claims.

Hameedul Alam added that there are other reports of Haque's death which indicate he was murdered by his own family members. He called for the police to investigate further into this matter.

The video shows Haque lying on his back with blood flowing down his face. He appears to be in pain and is breathing heavily. There is a gunshot wound to his head and neck area, and there are visible cuts and scratches on his body. His clothes are torn and dirty.

He is described as being in his 50s and has brown hair and blue eyes"
The recording casts a disturbing light on Bangladesh’s new drug-control strategy.,Бұл аудиожазба Банладештің есірткімен күрестегі жаңа стратегиясының олқылығын көрсетеді.,"Translate the following text from en to kk: The recording casts a disturbing light on Bangladesh’s new drug-control strategy. In Bangladesh, the government has been trying to control the spread of illegal drugs through strict enforcement and regulation of supply chains. However, this approach seems to have failed to curb the problem. It is believed that the lack of awareness among people regarding the dangers of using illegal drugs could be one reason for the failure.

The video below shows how the government is attempting to implement stricter regulations on the production and distribution of illegal drugs in Bangladesh. This includes setting strict rules for the cultivation of plants and animals used for producing illegal drugs, as well as implementing controls over the sale and distribution of these substances. The government also plans to enforce stricter penalties for those found guilty of illegal drug use.

In summary, the new drug-control strategy in Bangladesh appears to be ineffective due to a lack of public awareness about the dangers of illegal drugs. The government's efforts seem to focus more on enforcing existing regulations rather than addressing the root causes of the problem. The current strategy may need to be re-evaluated and adjusted to better address the issue. What are your thoughts on this? Is there any alternative strategy or policy that could help address the problem?

The parallels to President Rodrigo Duterte’s brutal drug crackdown in the Philippines are chilling.,Елдегі ахуал Филиппин президенті Родриго Дутертенің есірткімен күрестегі тым қатыгез саясатын еске түсіреді.,"Translate the following text from en to kk: The parallels to President Rodrigo Duterte’s brutal drug crackdown in the Philippines are chilling. It is a shocking and violent campaign that has left many people homeless, killed countless innocent civilians and caused great suffering and destruction. The government of the Philippines has been accused of human rights violations by the international community, including torture, extrajudicial executions and mass killings.
The country of South Korea is also facing similar issues with its own drug trafficking. The government there has also faced criticism for their handling of drug trafficking, which has led to the deaths of hundreds of citizens and the destruction of many property. In 2016, South Korean President Moon Jae-in was impeached and subsequently removed from office, but his administration did not show any signs of corruption or abuse of power.
What can we learn from this passage?
A) The government of South Korea faces challenges due to drug trafficking
B) The Philippines’ drug crackdown on the Philippines is considered very effective
C) The Philippines has more serious problems than South Korea regarding drug trafficking
D) There is no connection between drug trafficking and political corruption in either country

To determine what we can learn from the given passage, let's analyze each option:

This is a shocking statistic that shows how much of a threat they pose.

There's also a huge disparity between rich and poor countries in terms of their ability to provide basic necessities like food, clean water, sanitation, healthcare, education, housing, and employment for all citizens.

This is due to unequal distribution of resources, political power, and economic conditions among different countries, which leads to significant disparities in access to these essential services.

The global health system, which provides universal access to basic medical care and treatments for illnesses such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis, is currently facing severe challenges. The number of people affected by diseases has increased significantly over recent years.

To address this issue, the WHO (World Health Organization) has launched the Global Action Plan on Universal Health Coverage (G-AUP), which aims to improve access to health care globally by providing financial support to countries that can meet or exceed the minimum standards of the International Medical Association (IMA).

In addition, the World Bank has launched the Global Health Fund (G-HF), which focuses on addressing the root causes of disease through investment"

Tibetan Buddhism is a religion that originated in Tibet and is practiced by people of Tibetan ethnicity in China. It is also practiced by people of other ethnic groups in China and some foreign visitors. There are many Buddhist monasteries throughout Tibet.

In Tibet, it is not uncommon for monks to be arrested and tortured by the government because they believe in their faith. This practice has become widespread over the years as the Chinese government continues its crackdown on dissenting voices.

As a result, Tibetan Buddhists face severe persecution and repression both domestically and internationally. The Chinese government claims that it is protecting the rights of all religions but this claim appears to be a lie.

Tibetan Buddhism is an important part of the cultural identity of Tibetans and plays a significant role in shaping their worldview and values. In addition, Tibetan Buddhism has played a crucial role in the development of Tibet’s economy and culture.

It is a clear sign that they are determined to take drastic measures against the people and their property, as well as those who support them. In addition, the government has also shown its willingness to punish anyone who opposes it. The public opinion in South Korea is divided on how to deal with this situation. Some think that the government should be punished for its actions; others believe that it should simply continue to use force and not seek punishment.

The government's reaction can be summarized into three main points:

1) It has decided to increase its budget for military spending.
2) It has increased its army strength by 40% compared to the previous year.
3) The government has invested heavily in new weapons systems, including missiles, aircraft, tanks, and submarines.

In conclusion, the government has been taking unprecedented steps to strengthen its military capabilities while simultaneously increasing its military budget and expanding its arsenal. This decision has caused concern among many citizens, especially those who support the government's policies. However, some argue that the government's actions may lead to further escalation of tensions between South Korea and North Korea.

The death penalty is used as a deterrent against the illegal sale of drugs.

The death penalty for drug offenses in the UK and elsewhere is an ineffective way of punishing criminals who are caught and convicted. It has been shown that people can be deterred by being punished with life imprisonment rather than with the death penalty.

The death penalty is also ineffective because it doesn’t provide any sense of justice or fairness. A death sentence means that a person will die without ever having had a chance to have their case heard. This lack of justice makes people feel that they are being treated unfairly.

As such, the use of the death penalty should be banned. The government should introduce a new system of punishment which would punish offenders more effectively and fairly.

The death penalty is an effective way of punishing criminals who are caught and convicted. It provides the public with a sense of justice and fairness, and it serves to deter other criminal activity.

Therefore, we should ban the use of the death penalty in all countries where it exists.

In fact, it has been shown in many studies that the death penalty increases the rate of drug use and trafficking.

Furthermore, a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that countries with higher levels of incarceration have lower rates of drug use and trafficking than those with lower levels of incarceration.
In conclusion, we can conclude that the death penalty does not decrease the incidence of drug use and trafficking. However, it does increase the rate of drug use and trafficking if applied to criminals who are already involved in drug use and trafficking. The death penalty also has negative social consequences, as it may lead to increased violence and crime among the victims of the crimes committed. Additionally, it could be seen as an unfair punishment, since it is based on the victim's criminal behavior rather than their actions. Therefore, it is important to consider whether the death penalty should be used in cases where drug use and trafficking are causing harm to society.

The Business Side of Brexit,Брекситтің Бизнес Қырлары,"Translate the following text from en to kk: The Business Side of Brexit

The business side of Brexit refers to the economic impact on companies and individuals in the UK and Europe. This includes changes in supply chains, labor markets, and financial markets. In particular, it highlights the potential negative effects of leaving the EU on UK businesses, including increased costs for raw materials, higher prices for imported goods, and reduced competitiveness in certain sectors.

In addition, there are also significant risks associated with Brexit that could have a direct impact on businesses and individuals in both countries. These include geopolitical tensions, uncertainty about future trade agreements, and the possibility of increased tariffs or taxes.

Overall, the business side of Brexit is complex and multifaceted, with multiple stakeholders affected by the decision. It is important for businesses to understand these impacts and take steps to mitigate them before making decisions about whether to leave the EU. Additionally, governments need to carefully consider their policies and actions during the Brexit process to avoid further negative consequences for both countries.

Consumer price inflation is set to peak at close to 3% this year.,"Тұтыну бағаларының инфляциясы биылғы жылы өсіп, 3% деңгейінде тұр.","Translate the following text from en to kk: Consumer price inflation is set to peak at close to 3% this year. The main reason for this is that the US dollar has been in a state of depreciation since mid-2015, and it will continue to depreciate further. At the same time, China’s economy has grown much faster than expected, which means that its currency has also risen significantly.

As a result, the exchange rate between the Chinese yuan and the US dollar will rise by approximately 6%, which will cause the prices of consumer goods to increase.

The current exchange rate between the two currencies is around 7.9. This means that if we convert one US dollar into one Chinese yuan, the exchange rate would be approximately 0.84. If we use this exchange rate to buy or sell an item in the market, it would mean that the cost of purchasing or selling that item increases by about 1.4%.

Therefore, the overall price level of goods in China should rise by about 1.4%. However, because the average price level of goods in China has not yet reached the peak, there are still many consumers who may experience significant price hikes. As such, the government must take measures to control the price levels"

As such, the expectation is that the real wage will increase substantially, even if it falls below the minimum wage. The real wage is defined as the actual earnings of workers relative to the cost of living. It does not take into account the difference between their own income and the cost of living (i.e., the amount of money people spend on food, housing, etc.) so the higher the income, the lower the real wage.

In contrast, the nominal wage is simply the sum of the worker's pay and the cost of living. It takes into account differences between an individual's income and the cost of living, so a person earning twice the minimum wage will earn twice the nominal wage.

The truth is that it is the technological revolution and the surge in consumption in Asia – not the UK’s relationship with the EU – that will transform the way business is done over the next couple of decades.,"Негізі, ЕО мен Ұлыбританияның қарым-қатынасы емес, технологиялық революция және Азиядағы тұтынудың артуы алдағы онжылдықтарда бизнестің жасалу жолын өзгертетін болады.","Translate the following text from en to kk: The truth is that it is the technological revolution and the surge in consumption in Asia – not the UK’s relationship with the EU – that will transform the way business is done over the next couple of decades. The economic growth rate of the US, for example, has been 1.7% annually since 2008, while the UK’s growth rate has been around 1.3%. This means that the UK’s GDP per capita is about a third smaller than the US’.
The rise in consumption in Asia, particularly in China and India, has led to an increase in the demand for goods and services, which are often cheaper and more accessible. As a result, many businesses in these regions are now able to offer products and services at lower prices, making them more competitive on the global market. This shift towards a more consumer-centric approach is likely to have significant implications for both the UK and its competitors in the international business landscape.

In summary, the UK's relationship with the EU has been one of cooperation and integration, but this has been overshadowed by the rapid changes in technology and consumption trends in Asia. As such, it is crucial for the UK to adopt a more forward-thinking strategy that takes into account"
Brexit In Reverse?,Кері Брексит процесі болады ма?,"Translate the following text from en to kk: Brexit In Reverse? A new political landscape is emerging in Europe, with the UK leaving the European Union. The UK's decision has sparked a wave of protests and demonstrations across the country. The government responded by proposing a new democratic system that would involve direct democracy, allowing citizens to vote on all major issues, including national defense and foreign policy.

The government also announced plans for a referendum on EU membership, which was seen as a step towards greater integration into the bloc. However, the referendum was delayed due to concerns about voter turnout and fraud.

As the situation continues to evolve, it is becoming clear that the Brexit process is complex and requires careful planning and coordination between various stakeholders, including the European Commission, member states, and civil society organizations.

In conclusion, the current situation in Europe is challenging and requires a nuanced approach to navigate through the complexities of Brexit, while maintaining a sense of unity and cooperation among different nations within the bloc.
