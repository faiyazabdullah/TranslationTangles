Sage said:
- ""Some foreigners""
- ""have lived in China""

- ""with their host country""

If your initial attempt to interact with the Chinese is not successful
- ""then"" means ""then"", so we can translate ""if"" as ""如果"".

This leads to a situation where the foreign community becomes a circle of foreigners who do not have any contact with local people or local culture.

In this context, what are the effects on the local people? They are left isolated by the 'foreign bubble,' unable to connect with the rest of society. They become more vulnerable to the influences of the foreign community, as well as being exposed to new cultural norms. The foreign community also has its own influence on the local population, especially in terms of food preferences and consumption habits, such as fast food and online shopping.

The local people's isolation is further exacerbated when they cannot communicate effectively with others outside of their community. For example, if someone does not speak English, it makes it difficult for them to interact with foreigners in restaurants or cafes. The lack of language skills can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts between locals and foreigners.

Furthermore, the 'foreign bubble' creates a sense of belonging among"

Residents express concern about the potential damage caused by the increased amount of electronic devices on the streets, including the risk of cyber attacks and data theft.

They believe that the best way to preserve the beauty and tranquility of this area would be to protect the park with appropriate security measures, such as installing cameras and setting up barriers around the entrance.

The residents also stress the importance of maintaining a low carbon footprint while using the park. They suggest that visitors should minimize their carbon footprint by walking, cycling, or using public transportation instead of driving.

The residents further emphasize the need to respect local customs and traditions, particularly regarding the use of mobile phones and the sharing of photos and videos on social media platforms like Instagram.

Finally, they advocate for policies that encourage responsible tourism,"

It is said that the calligraphy and painting in ancient China are an important part of human civilization. In the past two thousand years, the ancient Chinese calligraphers have made great contributions to the development of Chinese culture.
