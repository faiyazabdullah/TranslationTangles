The quote attributed to the National Association of Programs in Progress (NAP) states that by announcing a warning about group movement, the government had recently passed a law.

Rise of the Crowds supports the law banning free baggage for returned flights.

This translation maintains the meaning and intent of the original Russian text. The phrase ""Ростуризм"" (Rosturizm) is a term used in Russian, which translates to ""Crowds"" or ""Population"" in English. It refers to the general population or public interest that rises during events or activities. 

The legal action described is related to returning or refunding items on an airline ticket, hence the support for laws that restrict such actions. In this context, it's about regulations preventing people from carrying unnecessary luggage on their flights after they've already boarded them. This could include things like oversized bags, pets, or personal belongings that should not be carried on a flight but are allowed to be checked when purchasing tickets. The support for these restrictions suggests a concern about maintaining order and safety on airplanes while respecting individual rights. Overall, it seems to be discussing measures aimed at maintaining social order and fairness within travel arrangements.
