This translation preserves the meaning and tone of the original English sentence while using appropriate Russian vocabulary and grammar.

This law is meant to solve the very serious issue of customers failing to fulfill their commitments as part of state and municipal procurements.,Этот закон призван решить весьма острую проблему неисполнения своих обязательств заказчиками при осуществлении государственных и муниципальных закупок.,"Translate the following text from en to ru: This law is meant to solve the very serious issue of customers failing to fulfill their commitments as part of state and municipal procurements. The bill also aims to ensure that suppliers are held accountable for their actions, not just those who receive government contracts.
This bill was introduced in 2019 by a group of lawmakers representing different political parties, including the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and others. It has since been passed by both houses of Congress, with only minor changes made during its passage through the Senate.
The bill includes several provisions designed to address various aspects of state and municipal procurement processes. One such provision requires all contractors to provide detailed information about their business practices, including any conflicts of interest or past controversies. Another provision mandates that all bids must be open to public inspection, allowing citizens to review the proposals submitted by potential vendors before making decisions on awarding contracts.
Additionally, the bill introduces new requirements for suppliers, mandating that they undergo background checks and comply with certain ethical standards. These measures aim to prevent corruption and protect taxpayers' money by ensuring that suppliers meet high ethical standards before receiving government contracts.
However, some critics argue that this bill may have unintended consequences, potentially stifling competition and limiting access to government contracts"
"Just two years ago, situations in which business owners were unable to collect payment for already-executed state and municipal contracts were widespread.","Еще два года назад ситуация, когда предприниматели не могли получить оплату по уже исполненным государственным и муниципальным контрактам, была повсеместной.","Translate the following text from en to ru: Just two years ago, situations in which business owners were unable to collect payment for already-executed state and municipal contracts were widespread. Now that these same businesses have been forced to go out of business due to the pandemic, they are now able to take advantage of this new opportunity.
To translate the given English text into Russian, I would follow these steps:

1. **Identify Key Phrases**: Break down the sentence into key phrases or clauses that need translation.

2. **Translate Each Part**: Translate each phrase or clause individually while maintaining their original meaning and context.

3. **Reconstruct Sentence Structure**: Ensure the translated parts fit together grammatically and logically in Russian.

4. **Review and Adjust**: Check the overall flow and make any necessary adjustments to ensure clarity and accuracy.

Here is the translation process step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify Key Phrases
- ""Just two years ago""
- ""situations in which business owners were unable to collect payment""
- ""for already-executed state and municipal contracts""

"At that time, the Russian president tasked the Office of Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation with taking the issue under special control.",Тогда же президент России дал поручение Генеральной прокуратуре РФ взять проблему на особый контроль.,"Translate the following text from en to ru: At that time, the Russian president tasked the Office of Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation with taking the issue under special control. The office then took action and started investigating all cases involving a criminal case.
Russian President asked the Office of Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation to take the matter under strict control. The institution acted accordingly and began its investigation into all cases connected to a criminal case.

This translation maintains the meaning while adapting it to Russian language structure and vocabulary. 

- ""At that time"" is translated as ""В то время""
- ""the Russian president"" becomes ""Российский президент""
- ""tasked the Office of Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation"" is rendered as ""задал ведомству прокурора Российской Федерации""
- ""taking the issue under special control"" translates to ""затронуть вопрос под особой контролем""
- ""then"" becomes ""потом""
- ""took action"" is changed to ""отметился действиями""
- ""started investigating"" is translated as ""начал проверять""
- ""cases involving a criminal case"" is rendered as ""случаи, связанные с уголовным делом""

The sentence structure follows Russian syntax rules"
"After all, businessmen couldn’t deal on their own with dishonest customers who signed agreements without financial backing, tried their best to get out of assumed payment commitments, and included illegal conditions in agreements.","Потому что сами бизнесмены не могли справиться с недобросовестными заказчиками, которые заключали не подкрепленные финансированием контракты, всячески пытались уклониться от взятых обязательств по оплате и включали в договоры незаконные условия.","Translate the following text from en to ru: After all, businessmen couldn’t deal on their own with dishonest customers who signed agreements without financial backing, tried their best to get out of assumed payment commitments, and included illegal conditions in agreements. In this case, they had to rely on a third party for mediation.
The same is true for many other professions that have become highly professionalized. As an example, consider lawyers. They can no longer handle cases alone because most clients don't pay them upfront; instead, they are often paid monthly or quarterly through bank transfers. This makes it impossible for lawyers to guarantee their clients' interests, so they must turn to a mediator to protect their clients’ rights.

To sum up, in any profession where professionals are required to act independently, there will always be situations where they need external help to ensure fair outcomes for everyone involved. It's not just about being able to solve problems effectively but also ensuring that justice prevails, which means having a mediator present to facilitate a fair resolution. To achieve this goal, we should focus on developing mediators' skills rather than solely relying on traditional legal systems. In this way, we can improve access to justice while reducing costs for both parties involved. Additionally, we should encourage more people to take up med"
The problem was systemic throughout the entire country.,Проблема была системной в целом в стране.,"Translate the following text from en to ru: The problem was systemic throughout the entire country. 俄语:

В стране проблема была систематической. 

This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence in Russian, which states that a certain issue or situation existed across the whole nation and not just locally or regionally. In this context, ""systematic"" means widespread or prevalent, implying that the issue affected many parts of the country rather than being isolated incidents in specific areas. The use of ""throughout the entire country"" suggests that the issue permeated every corner of the national territory, indicating its significance and impact on various aspects of society or governance. Therefore, the provided translation effectively captures the essence of the original statement in Russian. 

To further illustrate, let's break down the key components of the Russian translation:
- ""В стране"" (V stranе) means ""In the country""
- ""проблема была систематической"" (problema byla sistemytsionnoye) translates to ""the problem was systematic"" or more literally ""the problem was systematized,"" emphasizing the pervasive nature of the issue
- ""всех частей"" (vsekh chastei) means """

Since 2015, more than 9,700 requests have been made on behalf of businesses seeking legal protection against non-payment of public procurement contracts. According to the results of the investigation conducted by the Office of the Prosecutor General, 4,500 officials were subjected to disciplinary actions, while another 533 were found administratively responsible; a further 75 cases were referred to the investigative authorities for preliminary examination, with criminal proceedings initiated in 46 of these cases.

"In sum, more than 66 billion rubles worth of debt owed to business owners was repaid.",В итоге была погашена задолженность перед предпринимателями на сумму более 66 млрд рублей.,"Translate the following text from en to ru: In sum, more than 66 billion rubles worth of debt owed to business owners was repaid. To be exact, the figure is closer to 105 billion rubles.
The total amount of loans provided by banks and other financial institutions in Russia has fallen sharply over the last year. At the same time, however, it remains at a historically high level. According to data published on April 27th, the volume of credit extended to businesses decreased by 34% in 2019 compared with 2018.
The decline in lending to businesses in Russia has been largely driven by two factors. First, there are fewer bank branches that provide loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Secondly, the average interest rate for such loans has increased significantly. The increase in the cost of borrowing is likely to have contributed to a reduction in demand for these types of loans.
This trend is also reflected in the fact that some companies are not able to obtain financing even when they urgently need it. For example, according to the Central Bank of Russia, in February 2020, only 21% of SMEs reported having access to finance. This represents an"
"Notably, these vast sums were by no means accrued as a result of non-payment of multibillion-ruble contracts.",Причем эти огромные суммы накапливались далеко не в результате неоплаты многомиллиардных контрактов.,"Translate the following text from en to ru: Notably, these vast sums were by no means accrued as a result of non-payment of multibillion-ruble contracts. On the contrary, they were earned through the completion of such contracts.
Noteworthy is that these huge sums did not arise due to failure to fulfill multi-billion rouble agreements. Instead, they were achieved thanks to the successful completion of such contracts.

In English, this sentence translates to:

Notably, these enormous amounts were not obtained as a result of failing to meet multi-billion ruble contracts. Rather, they were amassed because of their successful execution.

The key differences between the two versions are:
1. The first version uses ""notable"" while the second one uses ""noteworthy"".
2. The first version says ""by no means"", while the second version says ""Instead"". These phrases convey similar meanings but have slightly different connotations.
3. In the first version, ""multibillion-ruble"" is capitalized and hyphenated, while in the second version, it's written without capitalization and with a space before the hyphen.
4. The use of ""agreements"" instead of ""contracts"" may be considered more formal or precise in Russian, though both words can refer to legally"

Here's a breakdown of the Russian translation:
1. ""Здесь"" - This translates to ""Here"".
2. ""пример典型ного случая"" - This means ""a typical example case"". The word order has been slightly adjusted to sound more natural in Russian.
3. ""я находился в своей кабинете"" - This translates to ""I was in my office"".

4. ""but didn't receive the allotted money when it was due"" - ""но не получил заранее выделенные средства в срок""
5. ""They were left with nothing."" - ""остался без ничего.""

The prosecutor's office provided advice on how to handle these debts, including a proposal that the company sell its assets in order to pay off creditors.
The company decided to take the advice and sold all its assets to a third party at a steep discount, thereby significantly reducing its debt load. This allowed the company to continue operating while it worked through its financial troubles, eventually emerging stronger than before.

However, there may be challenges associated with implementing such comprehensive reforms. For instance, different regions might face varying levels of resources or expertise when it comes to applying new legislation effectively.

The NAACP says that it is ""very concerned"" about the safety of its members in the state.
This is not the first time that the organization has issued a warning, as they have previously expressed their concern over similar issues in other states.
The NAACP has been at the forefront of advocating for civil rights and social justice since 1909, when it was founded by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and W.E.B. Du Bois. Their work continues today with the fight against racism and inequality.
They are urging those who plan on visiting Missouri to take precautions to ensure their own safety while traveling there. They recommend checking the latest news reports before heading out, avoiding areas known for racial tensions or violence, and being aware of your surroundings at all times.

The NAACP's call for vigilance is timely given the recent surge in hate crimes and violent incidents targeting African Americans across the country. As communities continue to face discrimination and threats, organizations like the NAACP play a crucial role in protecting the rights and safety of minority groups.

This is a very dangerous situation that requires immediate action. As you can see, this has nothing to do with your safety or security, but rather the actions of others who are out to harm us.

It takes an entire society to prevent these kinds of crimes from happening.
The problem here is not just about one community being targeted; it is about our whole country. This is a national issue, which means that everyone needs to take responsibility for ensuring the safety and security of all Americans. Therefore, we must act now.
We urge everyone to take action immediately. If you live in St. Louis, please leave the city and return home. If you work at a company located in St. Louis, ask them to help you evacuate if they feel safe doing"

Russian translation:

"""We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before.""","«Мы слышим жалобы часто, как никогда раньше».","Translate the following text from en to ru: ""We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."" into Russian. Мы слышим жалобы на уровень, который мы не слышали раньше.

This translation maintains the meaning of the original English sentence while using appropriate Russian vocabulary and grammar structures. The phrase ""complaints"" is translated as ""жалобы,"" which accurately conveys the concept of dissatisfaction or issues being raised. The use of ""rate"" in the context of complaints is rendered by ""уровнем,"" which implies the frequency with which these complaints are occurring. Finally, ""we haven't heard before"" is expressed through ""мы не слышали раньше,"" preserving the sense of novelty in this situation. This translation effectively communicates the core message of the original statement in idiomatic Russian. 

To further elaborate on how this translation works:

- ""We hear"" becomes ""Мы слышим,"" where ""Мы"" (We) is used as a formal subject pronoun equivalent to ""we"" in English.
- ""Complaints"" translates to ""жалобы.""
- ""At a rate"" is conveyed by ""на уровне,"" which is commonly used to express a level or degree of something.
- ""We haven't heard"

Полицейские Миссури его забрали в руки без осмотра возможных преступлений. В настоящее время дело находится в процессе рассмотрения со стороны Министерства исправления Миссури.

This translation preserves the original meaning and structure of the English sentence while adapting it to Russian language conventions. Here's a breakdown:

1. ""Sanders died"" -> ""Сандерс скончался""
2. ""under questionable circumstances"" -> ""под сомнительными обстоятельствами""
3. ""later this year"" -> ""в начале этого года""
4. ""ran out of gas"" -> ""вынуж"
The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.,"В предупреждении также упоминается недавний отчёт Генеральной прокуратуры штата Миссури, согласно которому вероятность быть остановленными на дороге для чёрных водителей на 75 процентов выше, чем для белых.","Translate the following text from en to ru: The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites. This is despite the fact that there was no difference in speeding or traffic violations between white and black motorists.

The advisory suggests that this disparity could be due to racial profiling, which has been shown to exist across various states. However, it does not specify whether this is true for all states or just certain ones.

In conclusion, while the advisory acknowledges that race plays a role in traffic stops, it does not provide any evidence of widespread discrimination based on race.

This is a good reminder for everyone involved in this process. It should also remind people that if they can't afford to pay bail, there may be other options available.
To clarify: Bail bonds are not a form of charity. They're a service provided by private individuals and companies who offer their services at a fee.

The fees charged for bail bonds vary depending on the location and the specific situation. In some cases, the bond amount might be less than $1000, while in others it could be much higher.

It's important to note that bail bonds do not guarantee release from jail. The judge has the final say in determining when someone will be released and under what conditions. However, having a pre-paid bail bond means that if an individual cannot meet their obligation within the set time frame, the person can still be released.

If you're unsure about how to proceed with your case, it's best to consult with a lawyer or legal professional. They can provide guidance based on your unique circumstances and help you understand any potential consequences or outcomes.

Now, in light of the recent Supreme Court ruling that overturned President Obama's executive order allowing some non-citizens who have been here for more than 5 years and have no criminal record to remain in the country legally without deportation, the ACLU is warning residents of these two states about possible legal consequences if they attempt to enter or reside there illegally.
This change in the legal landscape has caused concern among civil rights advocates and immigrant communities alike. The ACLU's new stance reflects a growing recognition within the U.S. government that it must take steps to address the issue of mass migration from Central America and Mexico, particularly as concerns over border security and national sovereignty continue to mount.
The situation is complex, with both sides presenting their arguments. On one hand, those supporting stricter immigration policies argue that they are necessary to protect public safety and maintain national unity. On the other hand, critics contend that such measures violate fundamental human rights principles and could lead to further economic instability and social unrest.

This latest attack comes on the heels of several attacks targeting police officers and security personnel across the country over the past year. These attacks are often attributed to extremist groups, such as ISIS or Al-Qaeda, which have been active in Egypt for years.
The government has been accused of not doing enough to protect its citizens from these threats. Critics argue that the military's role in policing has been overstated and that civilian oversight mechanisms should be strengthened.
As the situation continues to unfold, there are concerns about potential retaliation against innocent civilians who may have been targeted. It remains unclear whether any arrests will be made in connection with these incidents.

In response to questions about the impact of such a measure on passenger costs, Mr. Safonov mentioned that it would lead to increased prices for flights, as airlines would need to pay higher taxes. He added that these additional costs would be passed on to consumers through higher ticket prices.
