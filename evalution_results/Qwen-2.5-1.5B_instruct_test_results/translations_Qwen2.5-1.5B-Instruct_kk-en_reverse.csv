Rewriting the Monetary-Policy Script,Ақша-несие саясатының сценарийін қайта жазсақ,"Translate the following text from en to kk: Rewriting the Monetary-Policy Script
The monetary-policy script has been rewritten in a way that is more flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances. This approach allows for better coordination between central banks, which can lead to smoother policy implementation.

MUNICH – How long will major central banks blindly rely on rigid rules to control inflation and stimulate growth?,"МЮНХЕН – Әлемнің ең ірі орталық банктері инфляцияны ауыздықтап, өсімді ұлғайту үшін қашанғы қатаң ережелерге сүйене бермек?","Translate the following text from en to kk: MUNICH – How long will major central banks blindly rely on rigid rules to control inflation and stimulate growth? The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, the Swiss National Bank and the People’s Bank of China have all followed similar paths. Yet they are now facing a new challenge: how do we get them to change their minds?

The answer lies in understanding that the world is changing faster than ever before, with more people becoming aware of global warming and climate change. This means that the way in which central banks operate must also adapt to this new reality.

In fact, it may not be too late for these institutions to take action. In 2016, the Bank of England published its report on the effects of climate change on the economy. It warned that if nothing was done to reduce carbon emissions, there would be significant economic costs, including job losses and reduced productivity.

However, even after this warning, many central bankers remain unconvinced about taking action against climate change. They argue that tackling climate change could lead to higher interest rates and slower economic growth, which might negatively impact employment.

To overcome this resistance, policymakers need to find ways to balance economic stability"
"Given the clear benefits of nimble monetary policy, central bankers need to open their eyes to the possibilities that flexibility affords.",Епті ақша-несие саясатының жақсы жақтарын ескере келе орталық банктер бейімделгіштікке де мән бере бастауы қажет.,"Translate the following text from en to kk: Given the clear benefits of nimble monetary policy, central bankers need to open their eyes to the possibilities that flexibility affords. The ability to adjust interest rates in response to economic conditions is a key tool for achieving macroeconomic stability and promoting growth.
To illustrate this point, let's consider the case of China. With its economy growing at an impressive rate, it has been able to maintain relatively low inflation levels despite high domestic demand. This demonstrates how flexibility can be harnessed to achieve desired outcomes without resorting to excessive tightness or loose policies.
Central banks around the world are increasingly recognizing the importance of maintaining a balance between inflation control and financial stability. As they adapt to global market dynamics, these institutions will find themselves more inclined towards adopting flexible monetary strategies as a means of managing risks effectively.

In conclusion, while traditional rigid approaches may seem appealing due to their predictability, the advantages of being adaptable are undeniable. By embracing flexibility, central bankers can better serve their economies by adjusting interest rates in accordance with changing circumstances, thereby fostering greater stability and prosperity. Let us not forget that even the best intentions might lead to unforeseen consequences if we fail to account for them. Therefore, it is crucial for policymakers to continuously evaluate and refine their"
"The rule of thumb for monetary policymakers has long been that if inflation is below official target ranges, short-term interest rates should be set at a level that spurs spending and investment.","Ақша-несие саясатын жасаушылардың қалыптасқан дәстүрі – егер инфляция ресми болжалған диапазоннан көп уақыт төмен тұрса, қысқа мерзімді пайыздық үстемелер шығындар мен инвестицияға серпін беретіндей деңгейде белгіленуі керек.","Translate the following text from en to kk: The rule of thumb for monetary policymakers has long been that if inflation is below official target ranges, short-term interest rates should be set at a level that spurs spending and investment. But in recent years, central banks have moved away from this view, arguing that they can control inflation without relying on such an aggressive approach.

To understand how this works, let's take a look at the graph above. In the first panel, we see the relationship between the 10-year Treasury yield (which reflects expectations about future inflation) and the Federal Reserve Funds rate (the benchmark interest rate used by the Fed). As you can see, when the 10-year Treasury yield is low, it indicates that people expect higher inflation in the future, which makes them more willing to borrow money and spend now. This causes the federal funds rate to rise, as the Fed tries to slow down economic growth and prevent inflationary pressures from building up too quickly. On the other hand, when the 10-year Treasury yield is high, it means that investors are expecting lower inflation or deflation in the future, so they're less likely to borrow money and spend now. This leads to a decrease in the federal funds rate, encouraging borrowing and spending"

"For starters, households have not responded to ultra-low interest rates by saving less and spending more.","Біріншіден, отбасылар пайыздық үстеме тым төмен болса да, ақшаны аз сақтап, көп жұмсаған жоқ.","Translate the following text from en to kk: For starters, households have not responded to ultra-low interest rates by saving less and spending more. Instead, they have increased their consumption of financial products like mutual funds, bonds, and derivatives.
To get a sense of how much these financial products are worth, we can look at the total amount invested in them. The data shows that as household wealth has grown, so too has the amount invested in these financial products.
The growth in investment is particularly pronounced among the wealthiest households, who tend to be older and have higher incomes. In fact, for every dollar of household income, the wealthiest 1% invests $6.50 in financial products compared to just $2.80 for the poorest 1%. This disparity is especially stark when it comes to retirement savings, with the wealthiest 1% investing an average of $743 per month into retirement accounts while the poorest 1% only invests $29 per month on average.
This trend of wealthier individuals investing heavily in financial products is concerning because it suggests that the wealthy may have access to better information or opportunities than others, which could lead to further inequality.
It's also worth noting that this trend isn't limited to just the wealthiest households. Middle"

The TSP has been around since 1986 when Congress created it as a way for federal workers to save for retirement. Today, over two million federal employees participate in this plan, making it the largest defined contribution retirement plan in the country.
The TSP also includes a Roth IRA option for those who wish to convert funds from a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA without any penalties or taxes on withdrawals after age 59½ years old.

"Likewise, companies today are faced with so much uncertainty and so many risks that ever-lower costs of capital have not enticed them to invest more.","Дәл сол сияқты тәуекел өте көп болғандықтан, компаниялар да әрі-сәрі күйде тұр, капиталдың бұрын болмаған деңгейге дейін арзандауы оларды көбірек инвестиция салуға итермелеген жоқ.","Translate the following text from en to kk: Likewise, companies today are faced with so much uncertainty and so many risks that ever-lower costs of capital have not enticed them to invest more. The only way they can do this is by reducing their costs of labour.

The problem is that these costs cannot be reduced without compromising quality or innovation.
To make matters worse, in a world where every company is competing for customers' attention and loyalty, the pressure on cost-cutting has increased even further.
As a result, we see an increasing number of companies cutting costs in non-core areas such as marketing, IT, and human resources while ignoring other crucial functions like R&D (Research & Development).
This phenomenon is called ""cost reduction at all costs"" - it's a dangerous trend that will likely lead to the downfall of businesses that don't adapt quickly enough.
The key here is understanding how to balance between short-term gains and long-term sustainability.
In my opinion, there are two main approaches to achieve this:

1. Focus on improving productivity through better processes and technologies.
2. Invest in research and development to create new products and services that offer value beyond just price competition.

Both methods require significant investment, but the return on investment is worth it in the long run because it ensures"

The prevailing wisdom holds that in order to return the inflation rate to a preferred level, any slack in the economy must be eliminated. This is not only impractical but also dangerous.
The policy makers’ dilemma lies in the fact that if they were to eliminate all of this slack, it would likely lead to a period of high unemployment and low economic growth. Therefore, they have resorted to a more cautious approach where they aim to maintain a balance between inflationary pressures and deflationary risks. The current strategy involves reducing interest rates, which has been successful in stabilizing the economy so far.

This is an ongoing process as there are still some pockets of excess capacity within the economy. The goal is to gradually reduce these areas while ensuring that the overall trend remains positive for future economic growth. In other words, the central bank is trying to strike a delicate balance by maintaining steady interest rates without letting them become too loose or tight at the same time. They hope to achieve this through a gradual reduction in their quantitative easing program, which currently consists of purchasing large quantities of government bonds.

However, this strategy may face challenges in the near term due"

This is not surprising, given that the world’s largest economy, which has been a leader in economic development for decades, has struggled with high inflation.

The fact that countries like India and Indonesia have seen their currencies weaken against the US dollar since 2016 suggests they were forced to devalue their currency in order to maintain competitiveness. In this case, however, the weakening of the Indian rupee against the US dollar was caused by an increase in demand for its exports, rather than a decrease in demand for imports.
To understand why this happened, we need to look at the global supply chain and see how it has changed over time. The pandemic-induced disruptions have led to significant changes in manufacturing and logistics, creating new opportunities and challenges for businesses around the world.
In this context, the idea of ""devaluation"" may seem counterintuitive, as many people think of it as a negative action that leads to a loss of value. However, when applied to economies, it can be beneficial if used correctly. For example, if a country experiences a decline in productivity"

But they also argue that such risks are worth taking for the sake of higher growth rates.
Central bank officials have been discussing how to address these issues through monetary policy measures. They believe that increasing interest rates will reduce inflationary pressures, but may also lead to lower growth rates as well. This is why some policymakers are advocating for alternative solutions like quantitative easing or unconventional monetary tools.
It seems that there is no single solution to this problem. The best approach might be to adopt an open-minded attitude towards different approaches and consider all possible alternatives. In other words, it would be beneficial to look at how central banks could work together with governments to create more balanced economies by combining monetary and fiscal policies.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has already started exploring this idea with its Quantitative Easing program, which involves purchasing large amounts of government bonds. However, some economists argue that such actions should only be taken if accompanied by structural reforms aimed at reducing unemployment and income inequality.
In summary, the debate about how to tackle the issue of rising inequality"

This allows us to better understand the likelihood of extreme outcomes and take proactive measures to mitigate their impact.

In essence, we need a new approach that combines statistical methods with real-world observations to develop models that can predict the probability of rare events accurately. This requires a multidisciplinary team of experts who can bring together diverse perspectives and knowledge to create robust solutions. It's not just about making accurate forecasts; it's also about being able to act on them effectively when they happen.

The article discusses this issue in detail, providing evidence that shows how effective communication can lead to better economic outcomes. The author argues that when central banks communicate effectively, people are more likely to trust them and follow their advice on how to manage risks.

In contrast, the article also highlights the importance of transparency for central banks, emphasizing the need for clear and consistent communication about their decisions. It points out that this helps prevent misunderstandings and ensures that everyone knows what actions the bank intends to take.

This approach allows for better coordination among different stakeholders involved in financial markets, such as investors, businesses, and policymakers. By working together, these groups can make informed decisions and mitigate potential risks to the economy.

To summarize, the key takeaway from this discussion is that effective communication between central banks and the public has significant benefits. It encourages greater confidence in the decision-making process and leads to improved economic performance. In essence, the ability to communicate clearly and consistently is crucial for maintaining"

Haque's death has sparked outrage in Bangladesh, where the government has struggled to maintain law and order amid widespread protests against corruption and economic inequality. In response to the incident, police have launched an investigation into the death of Haque, but some critics argue that the case is being mishandled and that there may be more than one suspect involved.
The man known as ""Haque"" is believed to be Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh. She has denied involvement in the alleged crime and claims to be unaware of any information about the death of her husband. However, many people believe that this is not true, and that"

The situation is particularly dire for women and children, who often find themselves caught between the forces of law enforcement and criminal gangs. Human rights organizations say these young victims are being subjected to torture, rape, forced sterilization, and other forms of violence.
This crackdown, which began under Mr. Musharraf's rule, has continued under Ms. Zardari’s leadership. It was during this period that the country experienced a wave of extrajudicial killings and disappearances, as well as widespread corruption and human rights abuses.
The military is now seen as an even greater threat than before, given their role in suppressing protests against the ruling elite. In addition to arresting activists, they have also carried out raids on suspected militants and destroyed their weapons caches.

But he has a different message.

The president, who was born on June 26, 1947, is now facing charges for corruption and graft, having been found guilty of embezzlement by the Supreme Court. He was also accused of human rights violations during his time as governor of Davao City, which is located in Mindanao.

On Sunday night, Duterte gave an address that went viral online. It included a video showing him holding a gun at two women protesters outside the Capitol building. He then said “I have no problem with you killing me if you want to.” He also claimed he had not been able to visit his family since his arrest, despite being released after paying a $5 million fine last year.

In addition, he announced a new law allowing the government to deport any foreigner caught smuggling drugs into the country, including Chinese nationals. This move could be seen as a direct response to China’s recent criticism of Philippine drug laws.

Duterte, whose administration is known for its anti-drug campaign, has already made moves to limit freedom of speech and press. In August, the National Tele"

The two leaders have also taken different approaches towards foreign policy and governance.

The Philippines is a country that has experienced significant political upheaval in recent years. In 2016, President Rodrigo Duterte was elected as the new leader of the nation. Under his administration, there were several controversial actions such as the ban on drugs, which resulted in an increase in crime rates. However, he promised to reduce corruption and improve the quality of life for Filipinos.

In contrast, Sheikh Hasina's government faced challenges during her tenure. She implemented policies aimed at improving the lives of marginalized groups, including women and children. Despite these efforts, she faced criticism for her handling of human rights issues and conflicts with neighboring countries. Her leadership style is described as being more authoritarian compared to Duterte's.

Foreign Policy:
Duterte's approach to foreign relations can be characterized by a strong emphasis on national sovereignty and independence. He often speaks about how the Philippines should prioritize its own interests over those of other nations. This approach has led to tensions with some neighbors who feel threatened by his assertive stance.
Hasina's foreign policy focuses more on regional integration"

The police have been actively investigating drug-related crimes in the city, which has resulted in arrests and confiscation of large amounts of illegal substances. Despite this, there are still cases of high-risk behavior among users, such as sharing needles or using multiple partners, which increases the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. This highlights the need for comprehensive education and awareness programs on safe sex practices and drug abuse prevention, particularly among young adults.

To address these issues, it is essential to implement stricter laws against drug trafficking and distribution, while also providing support services for those affected by addiction. Additionally, public health measures should be strengthened to ensure the safety of drug users and prevent the spread of diseases like AIDS.

In summary, the government must take urgent action to reduce drug-related violence and protect the rights of citizens. Only through collective efforts can we hope to achieve lasting change and create a safer society for everyone.

The death penalty for drug offenses is often justified by saying that it targets only those who plan and organize criminal activities, such as drug trafficking. However, this view overlooks the fact that most criminals involved in drug-related crimes are ordinary individuals who make mistakes and are caught in the web of organized crime.
Despite the claims of some politicians, the death penalty for drug offenses does not primarily target high-ranking officials. It is instead used as a tool for controlling society and maintaining order.

It is also about power. The Bangladeshi government has been accused of supporting illegal opium cultivation by providing seeds and fertilizers. This amounts to a direct subsidy for criminal activity.
The government's actions are therefore not just immoral but also unconstitutional. It must be stopped immediately or the consequences will be severe.
This situation is not unique to Bangladesh. In other countries with large Muslim populations, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Turkey, and Pakistan, similar phenomena can be observed.
These countries' governments often provide financial support to farmers engaged in opium production, which results in an increase in this crop's availability and prices.

In summary, these governments encourage their citizens to cultivate what they consider a ""traditional"" crop, even if that crop is actually illegal and harmful to public health.
This policy is not only unethical but also dangerous. It could lead to widespread corruption and undermine the rule of law.
The international community should take action to prevent this practice and protect human rights.

The United States has taken a lead role in this process of global criminalization. This means that there are more than one million people worldwide who are currently living under the threat of execution.
This phenomenon has led to a growing number of executions around the world. In some countries like China, where death penalty sentences were abolished in recent years, there is a noticeable increase in the use of lethal injection as an alternative method of execution. However, even in such cases, it is not uncommon for doctors to administer multiple drugs during the procedure, leading to prolonged suffering and pain for the condemned person.
In other parts of the world, particularly in Latin America, there is a growing trend towards capital punishment. Despite international efforts to reduce the number of executions, the practice continues to be used in many countries. According to data from Amnesty International, at least 127 countries still carry out executions annually.

The Business Side of Brexit,Брекситтің Бизнес Қырлары,"Translate the following text from en to kk: The Business Side of Brexit

The business side of Brexit is one that I have been interested in for some time. As a member of the European Parliament, I had the opportunity to represent my constituents on many issues related to trade and economic relations with other countries. This included discussions about the potential impact of Brexit on our economy.

I believe that there are several important areas where businesses can be impacted by Brexit:

1. Trade barriers: One of the most immediate effects of Brexit could be increased trade barriers between the UK and the rest of Europe. This could lead to higher costs for goods and services imported into the UK, which would ultimately affect businesses that rely on imports.

2. Investment opportunities: Another area where businesses might face challenges is when it comes to investment decisions. With the uncertainty surrounding the future of the EU as a whole, businesses may hesitate to make large investments or expand their operations across borders.

3. Supply chain disruptions: Businesses also need to consider how Brexit will impact their supply chains. If they source raw materials or components from outside the EU, they may find themselves suddenly facing new import requirements or restrictions.

4. Competition: Finally, Brexit could also impact competition within the EU market. If the UK becomes an independent country,"

But there is a significant risk that these gains will fall short of expectations, as workers may feel less secure about their jobs.
And in this context, it's important to remember that despite the current economic climate, the need for skilled workers remains strong. In fact, many companies have already begun to invest heavily in training programs aimed at improving worker skills and preparing them for future challenges.
It's also worth noting that some sectors such as technology and healthcare continue to experience rapid advancements, which could create new opportunities for workers with relevant skills.
Therefore, while average wage increases may be modest, the potential for higher wages exists if workers can acquire the necessary skills and adapt to evolving job markets. To achieve this, individuals must prioritize education and skill development, ensuring they remain competitive in the global economy.
To sum up, we should view the current state of employment with caution but optimism. We shouldn't underestimate the importance of investing in our workforce, whether through training or other means, because doing so has proven beneficial in the past and continues to offer advantages today.

The Bank of England has already reduced its interest rate by 0. 2 percentage point as part of an effort to boost economic activity. While it is possible that these measures might not have the desired effect on their own, they may still play a role in stimulating growth in the future. This could help maintain the stability of the British economy, which relies heavily on consumer spending for growth.
In summary, while monetary policy actions can provide some support to the economy, fiscal policies such as government spending cuts and tax increases also need to be considered. These additional tools can complement the efforts made by the central bank to keep inflation under control.

The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.
This will lead to a number of changes in trade and immigration patterns across Europe, which could have serious implications for the future of the Union.
As the United Kingdom prepares to leave the European Union, it has been warned that its economy may face severe difficulties due to the country's failure to negotiate properly with Brussels.
The consequences of this failure are likely to include an economic downturn and job losses, as well as higher inflation rates and decreased investment levels in the long term.
Furthermore, the impact of leaving the EU on the global economy is also expected to cause significant disruptions, potentially leading to further declines in GDP growth worldwide.
To mitigate the potential negative effects of such a scenario, policymakers should focus on developing policies that promote sustainable economic growth, rather than focusing solely on short-term gains or maintaining the status quo.

In conclusion, while the immediate financial impacts of Brexit may seem overwhelming, they pale in comparison to the broader economic challenges that await the United Kingdom once it leaves the European Union. It is"
