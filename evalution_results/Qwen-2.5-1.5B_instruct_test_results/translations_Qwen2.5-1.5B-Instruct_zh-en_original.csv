The NAACP has issued a travel alert after passage of a Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, and the state's police are also partly targeted at minority groups.

This sentence translates the original Chinese content into English accurately while maintaining the meaning and tone of the original message. It highlights the NAACP's concern about recent legislation in Missouri that may make it more difficult for individuals to pursue legal action against discrimination, as well as the perceived targeting of minority communities by local law enforcement. This situation prompted the organization to issue a travel advisory to inform its members and allies about potential risks they might face when traveling in the area. Overall, this translation effectively conveys the key points of the original statement in clear and concise English.

This also suggests that while black drivers and white drivers are treated equally in most cases, they may still face inequality in certain areas. Additionally, the report mentions that black drivers are more likely to be stopped at night and have a higher likelihood of experiencing discriminatory treatment.

The text also discusses how these findings can impact police practices and policies. The author notes that the data collected by law enforcement agencies show a correlation between racial profiling and traffic stops. This means that if a driver is perceived as being of a particular race or ethnicity, they are more likely to be targeted for further investigation or questioning.
The study found that the rate of racial discrimination was significantly lower than previously reported. It noted that this decline was not due to changes in policing tactics but"

The translation of this sentence into English is:

""People need to be prepared either by carrying bail money to Missouri or by letting relatives know they are traveling within the state."" 

This is referencing the fact that Missouri does not have a parole or probation system, so anyone who commits a crime in the state will be held responsible for their actions. The phrase ""being held accountable"" means being punished by law. 

In this context, the person speaking emphasizes the importance of taking necessary precautions when traveling in Missouri, as there is no provision for release on bail or conditional supervision. By preparing themselves through financial means (carrying bail money) or informing family members about their travels, individuals can mitigate potential legal consequences associated with criminal activity within the state's jurisdiction.
