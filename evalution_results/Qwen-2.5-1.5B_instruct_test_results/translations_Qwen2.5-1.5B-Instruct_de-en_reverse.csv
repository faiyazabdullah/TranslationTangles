Allotment holders cultivate the soil of former farmers.,Kleing√§rtner bewirtschaften den einstigen Grund von Bauern.,"Translate the following text from en to de: Allotment holders cultivate the soil of former farmers. Allotments are also known as allotments or kitchen gardens in English.
Allotted land is a type of agricultural property that can be used for farming and other forms of production. In many countries, allots are allocated by local authorities, such as municipalities or town halls.
In some countries, allotments have been replaced by community gardens, which are managed by groups of people who share responsibility for the land's upkeep. In others, allotments continue to exist as communal spaces for growing food.
The term ""allotment"" comes from the French word ""allot,"" meaning to distribute. It refers to the allocation of small plots of land for agriculture within urban areas.
In Germany, allotments are called ""Bauland."" They were originally created to provide housing for workers during the industrial revolution, but they have since become important sources of fresh produce for communities.
In addition to providing space for gardening, allotments often serve as meeting places for social activities and events. They may include recreational facilities like playgrounds, sports fields, and greenhouses.
Some allotments offer educational programs about sustainable practices and organic farming methods. Others may feature workshops on cooking with fresh ingredients from"

It is annoying when geographical maps are not up-to-date.,"Es nervt, wenn Landkarten nicht aktuell sind.","Translate the following text from en to de: It is annoying when geographical maps are not up-to-date. I know that it would be great if all of us could have access to accurate information about our world, but we also need to acknowledge that some things will always remain out of reach for everyone.

It is not only about being able to see where you live and what your surroundings look like, but rather it is a matter of understanding how our planet works and how different places interact with each other. It's important to remember that this knowledge can help us make better decisions in our daily lives, whether it's choosing which products to buy or deciding on the best routes to take for work.

So let's focus on improving these outdated maps by sharing them among ourselves. We should try to find ways to update them quickly, so that we don't miss any new developments in geography. This way, we can ensure that everyone has access to the most current information about their environment and its surroundings.

In conclusion, while it may seem frustrating that there aren't many updates on geographical maps, it's crucial to prioritize the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the information we use. By working together and spreading awareness, we can make progress towards creating more reliable and accessible geographical data for all of humanity"

In this translation, I have maintained the original meaning and tone of the English sentence while adapting it to German grammar and syntax rules. The key elements such as the location (West Park), the initial state of land (nothing but fields), the subsequent development into a detailed map, and the reference to property taxes are preserved. The use of ""hand-numbered"" for plots and ""so-called"" for ""original record"" reflects the technical nature of the information being presented. Overall, the translation preserves the essence of the original message about the transformation of an open space into a structured administrative document.

This translation maintains the original meaning while adapting it into natural-sounding German. The key elements are preserved - a green area located north of Untersendling and its establishment date on April 19, 2013. The sentence structure has been slightly adjusted for better flow in German. Additionally, ""Untersendling"" is transliterated as ""Untersendling,"" which is common when referring to place names that might not be directly translatable into German letters alone.

This is an example of how translation can be used to convey the meaning of the original text while also highlighting its cultural significance. The translation emphasizes the historical context of the place, as well as its importance as one of the world's largest festivals. Additionally, the use of vivid imagery helps to bring the location to life for readers who may not have visited or experienced it firsthand.

"On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.",Auf der anderen Seite der Isar gibt die historische Karte einen Einblick in die Geschichte der psychiatrischen Medizin.,"Translate the following text from en to de: On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine. Auf der anderen Seite des Isars zeigt die historische Karte die Geschichte der psychiatrie.

To translate this German sentence into English, I would do the following:

1. Identify key terms and phrases:
   - ""on the other side"" = ""auf der anderen Seite""
   - ""historical map"" = ""historische Karte""
   - ""insight into"" = ""einblick in""
   - ""history of psychiatric medicine"" = ""die Geschichte der psychiatrie""

2. Construct a grammatically correct English sentence using these elements while ensuring proper word order and meaning is preserved.
   
The resulting translation is:

""On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."" 

This accurately conveys the original German message about a historical map providing information on the history of psychiatry located on the opposite bank of the Isar river. The structure and meaning remain intact in the translated version."

And I was one of them.
The first sentence is in German and the second one is in English.

German translation:

This translation maintains the meaning and structure of the original sentences while adapting them into natural German phrasing. The key elements are preserved: ""Auerfeldstra√üe"" remains unchanged as it's a proper noun; ""verhaftet"" is used for ""imprisoned""; ""Dementien"" translates to ""delusions""; and ""vor ein paar Jahren"" means ""with delusions"". The rest of the words and phrases are accurately translated to convey the same sentiment and context as the original English text. This translation effectively communicates that a person was incarcerated at a location called Auerfeldstra√üe due to having delusional thoughts, which aligns with the historical context implied by the first part of the original text.

This translation aims to accurately convey the original meaning while adapting it to German grammar and sentence structure. It maintains the emphasis on the place's historical significance and its lasting impact on local communities. The use of ""erwachen lassen"" (to awaken) is appropriate for describing how these institutions came to life or became active. Additionally, ""die Jahre 1858 und 1859"" (the years 1858 and 1859) is kept as is since it provides specific context about when this happened"

From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution ‚Äì the psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II. The king was known as ‚ÄúL√ºbecker Lili‚Äù in his lifetime.
In German translation, it would be:

Von 1872 bis zu seinem Tod leitete der Psychiater Dr. Bernhard von Gudden die Institution ‚Äì der Psychiater, mit dem K√∂nig Ludwig II. starb. Der K√∂nig war bekannt als ""L√ºbecker Lili"" w√§hrend seiner Lebenszeit.

This translates the original English sentence into German while maintaining the same meaning and structure. It accurately conveys that Dr. Bernhard von Gudden was the leader of an institution associated with the death of King Ludwig II, noting that he was also known by the nickname ""L√ºbecker Lili"" during his lifetime. 

Here's a breakdown of key elements:

This is a quote about a historical figure who lived in the 19th century. He believed that people with mental health issues should not be treated like animals or locked away in institutions. Instead, he wanted them to receive proper care and treatment.
In this sentence, we have translated the English quote into German. The original quote refers to someone named John Brown, an American abolitionist who advocated for the end of slavery during the Civil War era. His actions were indeed progressive for his time, as they challenged the prevailing attitudes towards slaves at the time. However, it's important to note that modern views on mental illness are different than those of the past, and our understanding has evolved over time. In fact, many individuals with mental health conditions today do receive proper care and treatment.

The German translation preserves the meaning of the original quote while adapting it to sound natural in German. It captures the essence of John Brown's belief in treating mentally ill individuals with respect rather than isolation. This translation highlights the importance of considering how societal attitudes can impact individuals' lives and experiences throughout history. It also underscores the ongoing need"

Now it has 1000 beds, but is not yet fully equipped.
Das war fr√ºher Platz f√ºr 280 Patienten, sp√§ter wurde es auf 500 Betten umfassen. Heute hat es aber noch 1000 Betten und ist nicht voll ausgestattet.

In this translation:
- ""place"" becomes ""Platz""
- ""patients"" becomes ""Patienten""
- ""expanded"" becomes ""umfassend geworden""
- ""equipped"" becomes ""ausgestattet""

The sentence structure and meaning remain similar in both languages. The term ""full"" (voll) can be translated as ""ausstattet"" or ""ausger√ºstet,"" depending on the context. 

The final result maintains the original information about the hospital's capacity and equipment status. It should be noted that in German, numbers are typically written with a comma instead of a period between the thousands digit and the units digit. For example, ""500"" would be written as ""500"" in English, but ""500"

Here's a summary of my steps:
- I translated the given English text into German
- I made sure that the meaning and context remained intact
- I used appropriate vocabulary and grammar structures in German

The translation maintains the original meaning and structure while adhering to German language conventions. The key terms like ""district mental asylum,"" ""Haar,"" ""first floor,"" ""women,"" and ""confined"" have been accurately translated. The sentence flow has also been preserved for better readability in German."
