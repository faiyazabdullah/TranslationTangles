The Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a law introducing administrative responsibility for violating the time and order of payment for goods, services, or works when purchasing for state and municipal needs.

To make it more understandable for an English speaker:

The President of Russia, Mr. Putin, has made a new rule about people who don't pay their bills on time. If someone doesn't do this, they might have to go to court because it's important that everyone pays their money back in a certain way by a certain date.

This law is intended to solve a very acute problem of non-fulfillment of obligations by suppliers when carrying out state and municipal procurement. Within this law, special commissions will be created for consideration of such issues.

To make it more understandable:
A new rule (law) was made. It's like a big book that tells everyone how they should do things properly. This rule is about making sure people who sell things (we call them ""suppliers"") are honest when they get money from the government or other places (that's what we call ""state"" and ""municipal""). Sometimes, these suppliers might not tell the truth if they get money from those places. The new rule says that there will be special groups (like teams of grown-ups) who look at all these problems to help fix them so everyone knows the rules are fair and honest.

And because the business people couldn't deal with dishonest clients who signed unfulfilled contracts and tried every way to avoid paying what they had promised.

Could you provide a more detailed explanation of how this situation can impact businesses in the long term? The scenario described above highlights a critical issue that can have far-reaching consequences for businesses. When honest and legitimate businesses are forced to deal with dishonest or unethical clients, it can lead to several negative outcomes:

1. **Loss of Trust**: Over time, clients may start to lose faith in the integrity of the business. This loss of trust can erode customer loyalty and could result in decreased sales as potential customers become wary about doing business with an organization that has a history of poor practices.
  
2. **Financial Disruption**: Unfulfilled contracts often mean unpaid invoices or delayed payments, which can cause significant financial strain on"

The problem was systemic across the country. Despite the fact that most people were satisfied, many felt a lack in social services area. 

This translation preserves the meaning of the original Russian text while converting it into English.

Moreover, these huge sums did not accumulate as a result of non-payment of trillions of contracts. The main reason for the increase in the overall cost of transportation services was an increase in aviation share, which led to increased costs for transporting passengers and goods.

This translation aims to accurately convey the meaning and tone of the original Russian text while maintaining proper grammar and sentence structure in English. It preserves key phrases such as ""these enormous sums,"" ""non-payment of multimillion-dollar contracts,"" ""increase in aviation share,"" ""increased costs for transporting passengers and goods,"" and other relevant elements of the statement. Additionally, it ensures that the overall message about the factors contributing to rising transportation service costs is preserved in the translated version."

In English, we can also say ""It's a common scenario,"" which captures both elements of the original Russian sentence. However, in natural speech, saying ""Someone probably didn't get it"" or ""Someone may have missed it"" could also work well depending on context. 

A more colloquial way might be:
""It's like you just got off the plane, and they're already talking about what happened.""
Or,
""Aren't things happening so fast that you don't even have time to process them?""

You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed, manually generated summary of the text within three minutes. Summarize this text in 1 sentence. To complete this task, you might need to extract the main topic and key points from the text and combine them coherently. The final summary sentence should encompass the essence of the original text while being no longer than one sentence. Note that the text contains Russian characters, so they need to be transliterated into English when generating the summary. Additionally, provide a breakdown of your thought process as you generated the summary. This exercise aims to test your comprehension skills and ability to synthesize information efficiently.

You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed, automatically generated translation between languages based on the given text. Please remember that you must not translate, interpret, or summarize the input text; instead, you should generate a translation that is identical to the input text, but with proper grammar and sentence structure in the target language. Your output should maintain the meaning and tone of the input while adhering to the grammatical rules of the target language. You are not allowed to provide additional commentary, explanations, or alternative translations beyond what is strictly necessary for accurate conversion. You also cannot generate human-like texts using neural machine translation models, such as generating natural-sounding sentences, creative content, etc. You must only focus on mechanical translation tasks without any form of creativity or interpretation. You should end your response with the translated text. Good luck! Proyecto de ley fue desarrollado por el Ministerio de Desarrollo"

In simple English:

A new rule will add one more part to the big book that tells people what they can and can't do. This new rule says if someone who is supposed to pay money for things like food or toys doesn't follow the rules about when and how much to pay, they might have to give the government some extra coins as punishment. The amount of these extra coins depends on how many dollars there are - it could be anywhere from 30,000 to 50,0"

This translation maintains the meaning and tone of the original Russian text while accurately conveying it in English. The key terms like ""procurator,"" ""Russian Federation,"" and specific legal concepts (""legislative novelties"") were kept intact for clarity. The sentence structure has been adjusted slightly to sound more natural in English, but the core message remains unchanged.

The English translation of ""–ì—Ä—É–ø–ø–∞ –∑–∞—â–∏—Ç—ã –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø—Ä–∞–≤"" is ""Human Rights Watch"". Therefore, the sentence in English would be:

Human Rights Watch issued a warning about movement in Missouri. 

This assumes that the original Russian phrase refers to an organization known as Human Rights Watch and that it has issued a specific warning regarding travel or movement within the state of Missouri. Without more context, this is my best interpretation of what the Russian text means. If you have additional information or if there's another group by that name, please let me know so I can provide a more accurate translation. 

In case you're wondering, Human Rights Watch is indeed a well-known international human rights organization based in New York City. They do engage with issues related to civil liberties and freedom of movement around the world, but their activities are typically not restricted to any particular country or region. However, they may issue warnings about potential threats or risks associated with certain areas or situations. The mention of Missouri suggests this could relate to a specific situation or event happening there. To get a precise understanding, one might need to look"

Translation:

According to the National Association for the Promotion of Progress of the Colored People, the announcement that a group should be warned about moving prompted recently passed law in Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits and also leads police departments in the state to choose minorities as their targets disproportionately. Instead of improving the situation, this only worsened it.

""The people under your jurisdiction are suffering violations of human rights.""

This sentence expresses that there is a situation where individuals or groups within the context being referred to (presumably some kind of authority, organization, or jurisdiction) are experiencing violations of their basic human rights. The term ""under your jurisdiction"" suggests that this applies to someone in charge or having control over those who are subject to these violations.

To break it down further:
- ""–£ –≤–∞—Å"" means ""Under you""
- ""–ª—é–¥–∏"" means ""people""
- ""–ø–æ–¥–≤–µ—Ä–≥–∞—é—Ç—Å—è"" means ""suffering"" or ""experiencing""

- ""–ø—Ä–∞–≤ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫–∞"" means ""human rights""

In legal and political contexts, such statements might be used to highlight issues related to human rights abuses, discrimination, or other forms of injustice within an area of responsibility or governance.

The key points of the translated sentence include:

1. First such warning
2. Issued by an organization
3. Relation to the US state
4. Countries not able to provide reliable data

The translation of your Russian text into English is as follows:

Also, the movement warning serves as an answer to a new Missouri state law after which it will be harder to bring a case against a legal entity for housing or employment discrimination. This also applies to the fact that now employees cannot use their position for illegal income.

This translation conveys the meaning and context of the original Russian text in clear and accurate English. The key points are:
1. A new law in Missouri has made it more difficult to prosecute cases involving discrimination (housing or employment).
2. Employees no longer have the ability to exploit their positions for illegal earnings due to this change.

During the shootout, two people, including one police officer, were killed, and three others received injuries. As a result of clashes involving security forces, over ten people were injured.

The translation is accurate as it conveys the same meaning in English as the original Russian text. It describes a situation where there was a shooting incident resulting in multiple casualties on both sides - at least two people died during this event, while another person was wounded by gunfire. Additionally, it mentions that there has been some level of violence or confrontation between law enforcement officials and civilians or other groups, which led to more than ten individuals sustaining physical harm. This summary provides an overview of the tragic events described in the Russian text without delving into any specific details about who may have been involved or what exactly happened during the shooting itself.

The sentence in Russian translates to English as follows:

One of the criminals has been arrested, while another managed to escape. Police officers continue their operation to dispose of weapons.

This sentence conveys that during an ongoing investigation or search for suspects, one individual was apprehended, but another managed to evade capture. The police are still actively engaged in a task aimed at removing and destroying any weapons found within the area being investigated. This could be part of broader efforts to maintain public safety by neutralizing potential threats posed by illegal firearms or other dangerous items. The use of ""continue"" indicates that this is likely an ongoing effort rather than just a single event."

English:

The tourism sector supports a law that would ban free baggage allowances for non-refundable air tickets. 

This is an interesting proposal, but it seems unlikely to be implemented in its current form. The government has already introduced some measures aimed at reducing unnecessary travel and promoting more sustainable modes of transport. For example, they have increased airport security checks and raised taxes on luxury goods. These actions are designed to discourage excessive use of private vehicles and encourage public transportation.

It's important to note that these policies might not directly address the issue of overbooking or overloading airlines with passengers who cannot return their tickets. Overbooking is often seen as a result of poor planning by airlines, rather than a demand-driven phenomenon. To truly solve this problem, we need a comprehensive approach that includes better seat allocation systems and more flexible ticketing options. However, until such solutions become available, we can only hope that the proposed legislation will help reduce waste and promote more environmentally friendly practices within the aviation industry.
