"New Yorgi kinnisvaramagnaat Barbara Corcoran suutis teisendada tuhande dollari suuruse laenu viie miljardi vääriliseks kinnisvaraettevõtteks, enne kui rakendas oma asjatundlikkust teleekraanil, osaledes ABC tõsielusarja ""Shark Tank"" investorite paneelis.","New York real-estate tycoon, Barbara Corcoran, turned a $1,000 loan into a $5 billion real estate business, before taking her expertise to the small screen, serving on the panel of investors on ABC's Shark Tank.","Here's the translation of the Estonian text to English:

New York real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran managed to turn a $1,000 loan into a $5 billion real estate company before applying her expertise on television, participating in the investor panel of the ABC reality show ""Shark Tank""."
"Laila Ali on käinud oma isa jälgedes, saades neljakordse võitmatu tšempionina kõige edukamaks naispoksijaks, enne kui tema resümeesse lisandusid veel telesaatejuhi, autori ja kõneleja rollid.","Laila Ali followed in her father's footsteps, becoming the most successful female in women's boxing as a four-time undefeated champion before adding TV host, author and speaker to her resume.","Laila Ali has followed in her father's footsteps, becoming a four-time undefeated champion and the most successful female boxer before adding television host, author, and speaker roles to her resume."
"Vaatamata nende unikaalsetele karjääriteekondadele (või ehk hoopis nende tõttu) värbas TJ Maxx ometi mõlemad naised, et nad aitaksid rääkida saalitäiele lootusrikastele ettevõtjatele stereotüüpide murdmisest ja kõrgelennuliste eesmärkide saavutamisest.","Yet despite (or perhaps because of) their unique career paths, TJ Maxx enlisted the help of both women to talk breaking stereotypes and accomplishing lofty goals to a ballroom full of hopeful entrepreneurs.","Despite their unique career paths (or perhaps because of them), TJ Maxx still managed to recruit both women to help speak to entrepreneurs about breaking stereotypes and achieving high-flying goals."
"Eelmisel aastal kõneles T.J. Maxx sadadele naistele poodides üle riigi ja avastas, et 80 protsenti neist tunneb, et ühiskond on seadnud neile stereotüüpselt kindlad rollid ja ootused.","Last year, T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in stores across the country and discovered that 80 percent feel stereotyped by society into specific roles and expectations.","Last year, T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in stores across the country and found that 80 percent of them feel that society has stereotypically assigned them certain roles and expectations."

As a result, they came up with the project The Maxx You Project, to help women break down these barriers."

They may be at the top of their field now, but the journey there wasn't smooth for either of them."
Corcoran sai keskkoolis ja kolledžis hindeks peamiselt D-sid ja oli töötanud 23-aastaseks saades juba 20 töökohal.,"Corcoran earned straight D's in high school and college, hopped between 20 jobs by the time she turned 23.",Corcoran received mostly D's in high school and college and had already worked at 20 jobs by the time he was 23 years old.

Need kaks pehmelt öeldes pakatavad läbi raskuste omandatud teadmistest.,To say the two are brimming with hard-learned advice is an understatement.,"They, in a gentle way, offer knowledge gained through overcoming difficulties."
