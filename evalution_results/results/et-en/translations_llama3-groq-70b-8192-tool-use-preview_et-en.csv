Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in stores across the country and discovered that 80 percent feel stereotyped by society into specific roles and expectations.","Last year, T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in stores across the country and found that 80% of them feel that society has placed stereotypical roles and expectations on them."
