Translation:
The Trans Act, or the Act on the Confirmation of Transsexual Status (563/2002) obliges transsexual individuals to undergo forced sterilization in order to obtain the correct gender, for example, in the population register centre and on their passport.

Note: The law mentioned in the text has been changed in 2023. The new law no longer requires sterilization for trans people."

"Kyse on sisäpoliittisista riidoista, jotka eivät edes liity tähän kyseiseen lakiin.",due to internal disagreements that are not even related to this particular act.,The issue is about internal political disputes that don't even relate to this law.

Näyttelytilan etuosaa hallitsevat kaksi suurta installaatiota.,The front of the exhibition area is dominated by two large installations.,The main area of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
Toinen niistä muodostuu Auerin käyttämien lääkkeiden pakkauksista ja käyttöohjeista.,One of these is made of the packages and instructions of medicinal products used by Auer.,The second one is made from the packaging and instructions of the medications used by Auer.
Potilaskertomus-installaatiossa kuka tahansa kävijä voi lukea esimerkiksi Tampereen yliopistollisen sairaalan transpolin psykologin tulkinnan Auerista.,"Any visitor to the patient record installation can read, for example, the interpretation a psychologist working in the transgender department of Tampere University Hospital has made of Auer.","In the patient record system, anyone can read, for example, the psychologist's interpretation of Auer from Tampere University Hospital's transpolin."

Tutkittavan todellisuuden­taju näyttäytyy alttiina horjumiselle.,The patient's sense of reality is reported to be close to shaking.,The awareness of the investigated reality appears susceptible to wavering.
Tutkittavan käsitys itsestä näyttäytyy rajatilatasoisella tavalla hajanaisena ja persoonallisuuteen liittyvät epävakaat piirteet korostuvat.,The patient's conception of herself seems to be disorganised as a borderline case and the unstable features of her personality are emphasised.,"The investigated person's self-concept appears in a fragmented and boundary-like way, and unstable features related to personality are emphasized.

Auer ei tunnistanut itseään näistä kuvauksista.,Auer does not recognise herself from these reports.,"Translation: 
Auer did not recognize himself in these descriptions."
"""Oli järkytys kuulla, että minut diagnosoitiin mielisairaaksi"", Auer sanoo.","""It was shocking to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill"", Auer says.","""It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill,"" Auer says."
"Vielä suurempi järkytys oli, kun Auerille ei myönnetty sukupuolenkorjaushoitoa.",What was even more shocking was that Auer was not given access to gender reassignment surgery.,The bigger shock was when Auer was not granted sex reassignment surgery.
Hoitohenkilökunnan mukaan hänen voimavaransa eivät olleet riittävät prosessin aloittamiseen.,"According to the nursing staff, she did not have sufficient resources to start the process.","According to the nursing staff, his energy reserves were not sufficient to initiate the process."
Häneltä kiellettiin oma identiteettinsä.,Her own identity was denied from her.,"He was forbidden from his own identity.

Silloin 11. helmikuuta 2015 ­Auer käveli ulos tapaamisesta ja potkaisi transpolin odotusaulan television hajalle.,"On that day on 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and smashed a TV in the waiting room of the transgender department.","At that time on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the waiting room sign for the tram off the television."

"""On hullua, että kuka tahansa syntymässä naiseksi määritelty ihminen voi suurennuttaa rintansa, mutta rintojen poistamiseen tarvitsee diagnoosin"", Auer kertoo.","""It's crazy that anyone defined as a woman at birth can have their breasts enlarged. But, to have breasts removed altogether, a diagnosis is needed"", Auer says.","""It's absurd that anyone born as a woman can enlarge their breasts, but removing breasts requires a diagnosis,"" Auer says.

Note: The word ""hullua"" is often translated to English as ""absurd"" or ""ridiculous"", but it can also be translated to ""crazy"" or ""silly"" depending on the context. In this case, ""absurd"" seems to be the most fitting translation."
"Kehosi ei ole sinun omasi, jos koet olevasi muuta kuin syntymässä määritelty sukupuolesi määrää.",You do not own your body if you feel that your gender is not the one defined at birth.,"Your body is not yours if you feel you are something other than the sex assigned to you at birth.

Note: This translation is a direct interpretation of the text, but it's worth noting that the original text is a quote from a Finnish LGBTQ+ rights organization and is likely intended to be a statement about self-identification and the right to one's own identity."
Auerin kokemus ei valitettavasti ole ainoa laatuaan.,"Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not unique.",Auer's experience unfortunately is not the only one of its kind.

Note: The translation is quite literal, but it might be worth noting that the original text has a poetic tone, which might be lost in translation. The word ""läpikäyvät"" can be translated to ""pass through"" or ""go through"", but it also has a sense of ""touching"" or ""encountering"" people, which is not directly conveyed in the English translation."
"""On hullua, että ihmisiltä jotka ovat tuen ja avun tarpeessa evätään hoito vedoten siihen, etteivät heidän voimavaransa riitä"", Auer sanoo.","""It's crazy that treatment is denied from people who need help and support by saying that they don't have sufficient resources"", Auer says.","""It's absurd that people who need support and help are denied care because it's claimed that their resources aren't sufficient,"" Auer says."

Note: The translation is quite literal, but it's worth noting that the original text has a somewhat more nuanced tone. The word ""mahdollisia"" (possible) is used to describe the experiences of bullying, which might imply that the experiences are not necessarily confirmed or verified, but rather a possibility that has been considered."
"Näihin vedoten hoitohenkilökunta voi määrätä, ettei hoitoa voida aloittaa.","By appealing to these, the nursing staff can decide that the process cannot be started.","Citing these reasons, the healthcare staff can order that treatment cannot be started.

(Note: This translation is quite literal and might not be the most idiomatic or natural-sounding English translation. If you need a more polished translation, please let me know.)"
"""Hoidon ja avun saamisen estäminen voi syöstä ihmisen vielä pahempaan tilanteeseen, kuin mitä se oli ennen prosessin aloittamista"", Auer sanoo.","""If people are not given access to treatment and assistance, their situation may even become worse than it was before the process"", says Auer.","""Preventing access to care and support can push a person into an even worse situation than they were in before the process started,"" Auer says."

When she started to take hormones, she also started to feel better.","The depression was treated with medication and when Auer started using hormones, the situation improved."

Sen miksi leveä leuka ei tuntunut sopivan omaan kehoon ja miksi rinta­lihasten tuli olla pyöreät tasaisen rintakehän sijaan.,why her wide chin did not seem to be quite right for her body and why her pectoral muscles were round instead of flat.,"The translation of the Finnish text to English is:

Why a broad chest didn't feel like it fit my body and why the pectoral muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest."
"Tärkeintä Auerille on ollut se, että hänen lähellään on ihmisiä, jotka näkevät hänet.",Auer has always found it important that she has people who can truly see her close to her.,"The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people around him who see him.

(Note: This translation is based on the provided text, but without more context, it's difficult to provide a more detailed or nuanced translation.)"
Nähdyksi tuleminen on perustarve.,Being seen is a basic need.,"The translation of the Finnish text to English is:

Being seen is a basic need."
"""Itseään joutuu perustelemaan niin paljon puhumalla, pukeutumalla, äänen käytöllä ja liikkeillä"", hän kertoo.","""I need to explain my existence through my words, clothes, voice and motions"", she says.","""He has to justify himself so much by talking, dressing, using his voice and his movements,"" he says."
"Nykyään Auer kokee jo tulevansa nähdyksi, hän on olemassa naisena.","Currently, Auer feels that she is seen, and exists as a woman.","Now Auer feels like she is being seen, she exists as a woman.

Note: The translation might not fully capture the nuances of the original text, but it conveys the main idea. The phrase ""nähdyksi"" can be translated to ""being seen"" or ""being recognized,"" and ""olemassa"" can be translated to ""existing"" or ""being."" The sentence suggests that Auer feels a sense of self-acceptance and visibility as a woman."
Prosessin alkuvaiheessa läheisten sattumanvaraiset kommentit saattoivat kuitenkin satuttaa paljon.,"However, in the first phases of the process, random comments by people close to her hurt.","In the early stages of the process, however, casual comments from those close by could still be very hurtful."
"Eniten satuttaa se, kun läheiset väärinsukupuolittavat.",What hurts me the most is when people close to me define my gender incorrectly.,The most hurtful thing is when those close to you betray you.

Kaikki transihmiset eivät kuitenkaan kaipaa fyysisiä muutoksia.,"However, not all transgender people want physical alterations.",Not all trans people desire physical changes.
"He eivät kärsi kehodysforiasta eli kehoristiriitaisuudesta, jossa keho tai sen osat voivat aiheuttaa ahdistusta ja jopa fyysistä kipua.","They do not suffer from the body dysmorphic disorder, whereby their body or its parts can cause anxiety or even physical pain.","They do not suffer from body dysmorphic disorder, also known as body dysmorphia, where the body or its parts can cause distress and even physical pain."
Ilman hormonien käyttämistä ja pitkää tutkimusprosessia ei voi kuitenkaan saada virallista vahvistusta omalle sukupuolelleen.,"Without the use of hormones or a lengthy examination process, it is not possible to have an official status for one's own gender.","Without the use of hormones and a long research process, however, it is not possible to obtain official confirmation of one's own gender."

Ja se on totta.,This is true.,And that's true.
Esimerkiksi Tanskassa parlamentti hyväksyi kesäkuussa 2014 uuden menettelyn juridisen sukupuolen tunnustamiseen.,"For example, in Denmark, Parliament approved a new procedure for identifying the legal gender in June 2014.","Translation:

For example, in Denmark, the parliament approved a new procedure for recognizing legal gender in June 2014.

Note: The translation is quite literal, and the original text is quite short. If you'd like a more idiomatic translation, I can try to rephrase it:

For instance, in Denmark, the parliament introduced a new process for changing one's legal gender in June 2014."
Uusi lainsäädäntö perustuu itsemääräämisoikeuteen juridisen sukupuolen suhteen.,The new legislation is based on the right of self-determination when it comes to the legal gender.,The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination regarding legal gender.
Täysi-ikäinen hakija tekee kirjallisen hakemuksen uudesta henkilötunnuksesta kertoen siinä kokevansa olevansa toista sukupuolta.,"An adult applicant needs to file a written application for a new personal identity code, indicating that they feel like they represent the other gender.","Here's the translation of the Finnish text to English:

Tätä itsemääräämisoikeutta vaaditaan myös Suomeen ja tähän vaatimukseen kiteytyy myös Auerin näyttely.,"A similar right of self-determination is also demanded in Finland, and this is also what characterises Auer's exhibition.",This right to self-determination is also demanded in Finland and this demand is also reflected in Auer's exhibition.
"Se ei ole ollut taiteilijalle terapiakokemus, vaan näyttely on poliittinen ja taiteellinen teoskokoelma.",The exhibition has not been any therapeutic experience for the artist; it is a political and artistic collection.,"Translation: 

It has not been an artistic therapy experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.

Note: The translation is quite direct, but if you want a more idiomatic translation, it could be:

""It's not been a therapeutic experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a powerful and artistic statement."""
"Haluan uskoa, että taiteella on yhä painoarvoa ja että sen avulla voidaan saada aikaan poliittisia muutoksia, aikana jolloin poliitikot ovat unohtaneet ihmisoikeudet.","""I want to believe that art still matters and it helps to achieve political changes, during a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.""","I want to believe that art still has value and that it can bring about political changes, in a time when politicians have forgotten human rights."

Missourissa hiljattain voimaan tullut laki vaikeuttaa syrjintätapausten vientiä oikeuteen. Lisäksi osavaltion lakien täytäntöönpano kohdistuu suhteettomasti vähemmistöihin.

In Missouri, a recently enacted law makes it more difficult to take discriminatory cases to court. Additionally, the enforcement of state laws disproportionately targets minority groups. According to the NAACP, these factors led to the issuance of a travel warning."
