由于密苏里州的歧视性政策和种族主义袭击，美国有色人种促进协会 (NAACP) 向准备前往密苏里州出游的有色人群发出旅行警告。,The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.,"Due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has issued a travel advisory for people of color planning to visit Missouri."
“2017 年 8 月 28 日生效的 NAACP 密苏里州旅行咨询中呼吁，因近期密苏里州发生了一系列可疑的种族性事件，所有非裔美籍旅行者、游客以及密苏里州人在密苏里州旅行时应特别注意并采取极其谨慎的态度，特此告知，”该团体的声明宣称。,"""The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein,"" the group's statement reads.","The NAACP's travel advisory for Missouri, which went into effect on August 28, 2017, urges African American travelers, tourists, and Missouri residents to exercise extreme caution while traveling in Missouri, due to a series of suspicious racial incidents that have recently occurred there, the statement by the organization claims."
NAACP 指出，最近通过的一项密苏里州法律使得人们更难赢得歧视诉讼，该州执法也一定程度上针对少数群体，这些现象促使该组织发布了旅行警告。,"A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.","The NAACP has pointed out that a recently passed law in Missouri makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, and law enforcement in the state is to a certain extent targeting minority groups, leading the organization to issue a travel warning."
侵犯公民权利的行为正发生在人们身上。,"""You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.","""Infringing on citizens' rights is happening to people.""

他们因肤色被停车盘问，被殴打或被杀害，”密苏里州 NAACP 主席罗德·查培尔告诉堪萨斯城星报 (The Kansas City Star)。,"They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed,"" the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.","""They are stopped, questioned, and sometimes beaten or even killed because of the color of their skin,"" Rodney T. Quinn, president of the Missouri NAACP, told the Kansas City Star."
“我们收到了许多投诉，数量前所未有。”,"""We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before.""","""We have received an unprecedented number of complaints."""
这是该组织在美国针对某个州发布的第一个此类警告。,It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.,This is the first warning of this kind that this organization has issued in the United States targeting a specific state.
该组织援引了密苏里大学对黑人学生的种族诽谤以及 28 岁田纳西州黑人男性托利·桑德斯的死亡事件。,"The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.","This organization has referenced race-baiting against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of a 28-year-old black man, Tory Sanders, in Tennessee."
今年早些时候，桑德斯在可疑情况下死亡。他在密苏里州旅行时燃油耗尽，被密苏里州警方在无指控犯罪的情况下拘留。,"Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.","Earlier this year, Sanders died under suspicious circumstances. He ran out of fuel while traveling in the state of Missouri and was detained by the Missouri State Police without any criminal charges."
咨询中还指出，密苏里州总检察长办公室最近的一份报告显示，“与白人相比，该州的黑人司机被停车盘查的可能性要高出 75%”。,The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.,"It is also noted in the consultation that a recent report from the Office of the Missouri Attorney General shows that ""the likelihood of black drivers being stopped for vehicle checks in this state is 75% higher than that of white drivers."""
查培尔说：“该份咨询是为了提高人们的意识，警告他们的家人、朋友和同事在密苏里州可能发生的情况。”,"""The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri,"" Chapel said.","Qu Pixel said, “This consultation is intended to raise people’s awareness and warn their families, friends, and colleagues about possible situations in the state of Missouri.”"
“人们需要做好准备，无论是携带保释金前往密苏里州，还是让亲属知道自己在州内旅行”。,"""People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state.""","""People need to make preparations, whether it is to bring bail money when heading to the state of Missouri, or to let relatives know that they are traveling within the state."""
根据联邦调查局仇恨犯罪报告计划的最新数据，密苏里州在 2015 年记录了 100 起仇恨罪行；根据罪行量，该州在全国排名第 16 位。,"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.","According to the latest data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Hate Crime Statistics Program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, ranking it 16th in the country in terms of number of hate crimes."
旅行警告也是对密苏里州新法律的回应，该法律将使起诉住房或就业歧视企业变得更加困难。,The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.,"The travel warning is also a response to the new law in Missouri, which will make it more difficult to sue businesses for housing or employment discrimination."
此前，美国各州通过了移民执法法律，要求当地执法部门拘留移民违规人员，美国公民自由联盟 (ACLU) 表示此举会增加种族诉讼数量，并发布了针对德克萨斯州和亚利桑那州的旅行咨询。,"Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.","Prior to this, several states in the United States have passed immigration enforcement laws, requiring local law enforcement to detain undocumented immigrants. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has stated that this action will increase the number of racial discrimination lawsuits, and has issued travel advisories specifically for Texas and Arizona."
旅行警告通常是由美国政府针对其他国家发布的，但最近，咨询团体采取这一方式以应对美国境内的某些法律和趋势。,"Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.","Travel warnings are usually issued by the US government regarding other countries, but recently, advisory groups have adopted this method to address certain laws and trends within the US."
经历2015年票房猛增的“黄金时代”后，2016年整体电影市场进入了冷静期，能否突破去年440.69亿元的总票房成绩都成为一个悬念。,"After experiencing the “golden era” of a soaring box office in 2015, the film market retreated into a cooling-off period in 2016. Whether box office takings could surpass last year’s total of RMB44.069 billion is questionable.","After experiencing the ""golden age"" of explosive box office growth in 2015, the entire film market entered a period of calm in 2016, with whether it can break through the total box office revenue of 440.69 billion yuan last year becoming a suspense."

北美和西欧是对比特币接受程度最高的地区，即绿色块的分布更为集中。,North America and Western Europe are the regions that have highest level of tolerance to Bitcoin i.e. where green patches are concentrated.,"North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest degree of acceptance of Bitcoin, where the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated.

(Note: The Chinese text mentions ""green blocks"" which is a term used to describe regions with a high degree of acceptance or use of Bitcoin. The exact meaning of ""green blocks"" may vary depending on the context.)"
中东和拉丁美洲各国对比特币的看法呈现明显分化，上述地区的色块分布更为混杂。,"The views of the countries in the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin are clearly divided, so, the distribution of color patches in these areas is more mixed.","The views of countries in the Middle East and Latin America towards Bitcoin are clearly divided, with the distribution of color blocks in the aforementioned regions being more muddled.

Note: This translation is based on the context provided and assumes that the Chinese text is referring to a heatmap or some other visual representation of opinions towards Bitcoin. The phrase ""color blocks"" refers to the different colors used to represent different opinions or levels of acceptance towards Bitcoin."
其中伊拉克、伊朗、土耳其、巴西都是合法的比特币市场，阿富汗、巴基斯坦、沙特、埃及、玻利维亚等对其交易和使用有一定程度的限制，更多的拉美国家对比特币还没有发声。,"Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Brazil are all legitimate Bitcoin markets. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bolivia have some restrictions on the trading and use of Bitcoin. Most Latin American countries have not made any comments about Bitcoin.","Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Brazil are legal Bitcoin markets. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bolivia, among others, have certain restrictions on their trading and use. Many countries in Latin America have not yet spoken out regarding Bitcoin."
综合上述数据可知，在全球受统计的246个国家中，共有99个国家（或占比40%）对比特币的交易和使用不施加限制，即绿色和橘黄色的地区。,"From the above data, it can be seen that of the 246 countries that have been rated, a total of 99 countries (or 40% of the total) haven't imposed any restrictions on the transactions and use of Bitcoin. They are represented by green and orange patches.","Based on the aforementioned data, it is known that out of the 246 countries surveyed globally, 99 countries (or 40%) do not impose restrictions on Bitcoin transactions and use, which refers to the green and orange regions."
有7个国家（或占比3%）是受限市场（淡粉色），有10个国家（或占比4%）定义比特币为非法（深粉色），有130个国家（或占比53%）还没有更多的对待数字货币信息（灰色）。,"Seven countries (or 3%) are restricted markets (pale pink), 10 countries (or 4%) have defined Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53) %) haven't given comments on digital currency (grey).","There are 7 countries (or 3%) that are restricted markets (light pink), 10 countries (or 4%) define Bitcoin as illegal (deep pink), and 130 countries (or 53%) do not have additional information regarding the treatment of digital currency (gray)."
这说明，占全球主体（53%，超过半数）的国家仍在观望以比特币为首的数字货币在境内的合法性，也代表了比特币的“黑天鹅风险”依旧很大，因为其中一部分国家最终可能会作出限制数字货币的立法决定。,"This shows that countries that account for the global majority (53%, more than half) are still indecisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies represented by Bitcoin. This means that the “black swan risk” is still very large for Bitcoin, because some of these countries may ultimately make legislation that restrict the use of digital currencies.","This indicates that countries that make up the global majority (53%, more than half) are still observing the legality of digital currencies led by Bitcoin within their borders. It also represents that the ""black swan risk"" of Bitcoin is still very large, because a portion of these countries may eventually make legislative decisions to restrict digital currencies."
文章认为，全球监管机构对数字货币这个新兴类别还没有完全理解，可能是大部分国家还没有作出表态的主要原因。,The article believes that global regulators have not fully understood the digital currency as a new type of currency. This may be the main reason why most countries have not chosen a stance.,The article believes that the reason why global regulatory agencies have not fully understood the new category of digital currency may be that most countries have not yet taken a stance.
尽管比特币的“人气”自去年以来呈指数级增长，并不代表所有国家都感兴趣，可能有些国家担心当地法币因此受到威胁，或更担心数字货币被犯罪组织利用。,"Although Bitcoin’s popularity has grown exponentially since last year, it does not necessarily mean that all countries are interested in it. It's probably that some countries are concerned that the local currency may be undermined by digital currencies or that digital currencies are used by criminal organizations.","Although the ""popularity"" of Bitcoin has shown exponential growth since last year, it does not mean that every country is interested. Some countries may be concerned that their national currency will be threatened, or even more worried that digital currency will be used by criminal organizations."
华尔街见闻曾撰文详细总结了上周以来针对比特币的国际监管新闻，包括中国开始打击场外类交易所的集中服务在线平台和移动App、韩国仍在考虑关闭数字货币交易所、欧盟认为比特币还没有被广泛接受并警告投资者“赔到血本无归”的风险等。,"Wallstreetcn has published an article summarizing the news related to regulation measures against Bitcoin across the world since last week, including: China starts to crackdown on online platforms and mobile APPs of over-the-counter exchanges; South Korea is still considering to close the digital currency exchanges; the European Union holds the view that Bitcoin has not yet been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of “losing everything”.","Wall Street Watch has summarized the international regulatory news related to Bitcoin over the past week, including China's crackdown on centralized online platforms and mobile apps for off-exchange crypto trading, South Korea's continued consideration of closing digital currency exchanges, and the European Union's view that Bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warning investors of the risk of losing all their money."
华尔街见闻主编精选《读要闻|2018：全球央妈开启数字货币元年？》曾提到，从监管、接受/批判、采纳的任一角度来看，2018年都将成为全球央行的数字货币元年。,"Wallstreetcn Editor's selection: Reading News | 2018: Global Central Banks Are Ushering Digital Currency? One article points out that 2018 is destined to be the first year of digital currency for central banks across the world, viewing from the perspectives of supervision, acceptance/criticism and adoption.","The editor-in-chief of ""Heard on the Street"" selected ""Read the Headlines | 2018: Will the Central Banks' Digital Currency Open the First Year?"" which mentioned that, from the perspective of regulation, acceptance/criticism, or adoption, 2018 will be the first year of central banks' digital currencies, regardless of the angle."
俄罗斯等大国批评比特币合法性地位的做法，其实也是为了给官方发行数字货币让路。,The act of questioning the legal status of Bitcoin by big countries such as Russia is actually meant to make way for the official issuance of digital currencies.,"In fact, criticism of the legal status of Bitcoin by countries like Russia is a way to pave the way for the official issuance of digital currencies."
新华社马德里1月8日电（报道员谢宇智）巴塞罗那新援库蒂尼奥8日在诺坎普首次身披巴萨球衣亮相。,"On January 8th, the Barcelona new aid Philippe Coutinho showed up for the first time in Camp Nou with his Barcelona shirt, the Xinhua News Agency reported in Madrid by reporter Xie Yuzhi.","Xinhua News Agency, Madrid, 1st January 8th: (Reported by Xie Yuzhi) For the first time, Quintilliano, the new aid from Barcelona's Can Rigat food bank, appeared in Nou Camp wearing a Barça jersey on the 8th."
库蒂尼奥当日上午通过了巴萨的体检，并与巴萨主席巴托梅乌在一份将于2023年夏天到期的合同上签了字。,Coutinho passed a physical examination of Barcelona early that morning and signed with Barcelona president Bartomeu a contract that will expire in the summer of 2023.,"Cutino underwent a medical examination with Barcelona in the morning of that day and signed a contract with Barcelona's president Bartomeu that will expire in the summer of 2023.

(Note: I assumed ""库蒂尼奥"" (Kùtíníao) is referring to a person named Cutino, and ""巴萨"" (Bāsà) is a short form of ""巴塞罗那"" (Bāsàiluónà), which means Barcelona.)"
随后他作为巴萨球员，在诺坎普近7000名球迷面前亮相。,"Then he appeared in the face of nearly 7,000 Camp Nou fans as a Barcelona player.","Later, he appeared in front of nearly 7000 Nuremberg fans as a Barça player."
据西班牙媒体透露，库蒂尼奥的转会费总额或达到1.6亿欧元（1欧元约合7.77元人民币），是巴萨俱乐部及西甲历史第一身价。,"According to a Spanish media, Coutinho's transfer fee may amount to 160 million euros (1 euro≈ 1.77 Chinese yuan), being the highest paid player in the history of Barcelona and La Liga.","According to Spanish media, the total transfer fee for Kun Agüero could reach 1.6 billion euros (1 euro is approximately 7.77 yuan RMB), which would be the highest transfer fee in the history of both Barcelona Football Club and La Liga."
由于眼下库蒂尼奥仍有伤在身，他还需休整近20日才能迎来自己身披巴萨球衣的处子秀。,"As Coutinho is still injured at the moment, he still need recuperate for nearly 20 days before ushering in his debut in the Barcelona shirt.","Because Kutiniao (Neymar) currently still has an injury, he needs to rest for about 20 more days before he can show off his skills in a Barcelona jersey."
还有什么神圣的东西？,Is nothing sacred?,"What else is sacred?

The Chinese text ""还有什么神圣的东西?"" consists of the following parts:

* 还有 (hái yǒu) - still have, or what else
* 什么 (shén me) - what
* 神圣的 (shén sheng de) - sacred
* 东西 (dōng xi) - things"
现在特朗普的白宫正在瞄准自由女神像,Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty,"Now, Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty."
政权更迭最确定的标志是他们开始攻击雕像之时。,The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.,The most definite sign of a change in power is when they begin to attack statues.
美国人和任何人一样都赞同这一点。 因此，2003 年巴格达天堂广场的萨达姆?侯赛因被精心策划地推倒了。,Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.,"""Just like anyone else, Americans also agree with this point. Therefore, Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdos Square, Baghdad was carefully toppled down in 2003."""
"斯蒂芬?米勒 (Stephen Miller) 作为特朗普政府的关键智囊之一，在与美国有线电视新闻网 (CNN) 的吉姆?阿科斯塔 (Jim Acosta) 就总统关于严格限制合法移民的提议进行激烈争论时,他肯定知道自己对自由女神像砍出象征性的一斧会发生什么事情。","Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.","As one of the key intellectuals in the Trump government, Stephen Miller certainly knew what would happen when he symbolically hacked away at the statue of the Goddess of Liberty while engaging in a heated debate with Jim Acosta of CNN, regarding the president's proposal to strictly limit legal immigration."
公平地说，米勒并没有攻击雕像本身。,"In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.","To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself."
如果他这样做了，那么一群游船业主和自由主义的追随者一定会将他生吞活剥。,A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.,"If he did that, a group of boat tour operators and liberal followers would certainly devour him alive.

In this sentence, ""生吞活剥"" is a colorful and dramatic expression that means to be severely criticized, attacked, or ostracized by others. It literally means ""to eat (someone) alive while they are still alive,"" but in this context, it's being used metaphorically to describe a harsh backlash from a particular group of people."
但是他确实攻击了塑像的意义，尤其是在 1903 年埃玛?拉撒路的着名诗歌被刻在基座上时（这座纪念碑在此后17年方建成）而具有的意义。,"But he did attack its meaning, and in particular the meaning ascribed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed.","However, he indeed attacked the meaning of the statue, especially the meaning it had when Emma Lazarus' famous poem was inscribed on its base in 1903 (the monument was not built until 17 years later)."
正如米勒斥责阿科斯塔所说：“我不想在这里谈论历史的全部事实，但自由女神像是美国自由照亮世界的象征......。,"As Miller scolded Acosta: ""I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.","Just as Miller criticized Ackerman by saying: ""I don't want to discuss all the historical facts here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of America's freedom enlightening the world......""."
你所指的那首诗，那是后来又加上去的，不是原始自由女神像的一部分。”,"The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.""","The poem you refer to was added later, it is not a part of the original Statue of Liberty."
事实上，米勒是正确的，但是正如他自己所说的，这不是真正关于历史。,"Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history.","In fact, Miller is correct, but as he himself said, this is not truly about history."
这涉及到拉撒路惊世之语的现代回音，唯一一个国家似乎不仅邀请任何老移民，而且还邀请穷人中最贫穷的人：“你的疲惫、你的穷困、或者你的挤作一团的民众渴望自由呼吸，/苦难的人拒绝你拥挤的海滩。”,"It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: ""Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.""","This touches on the modern echoes of Lazarus's earth-shattering words, the only country that appears to not only invite any old immigrant but also the poorest of the poor: ""Your weariness, your poverty, or your crowded masses yearning to breathe freely,/The wretched refuse, I lift my lamp beside the golden door."""
不存在“苦难的人拒绝”在我们的屏幕变得更刺眼的一刻。,"There has never been a time when the ""wretched refuse"" has been more visible on our screens.","""The idea of 'people in distress refusing help' becomes even more striking on our screens.""

Note: This is a translated sentence from a Chinese article discussing the refugee crisis and people's attitudes towards it. The context implies that the sentence refers to the fact that, despite the worsening plight of refugees, some people still deny them help or support."
米勒并没有从事过文学评论工作，他清楚地表明，这些人在特朗普时代的美国不会受到欢迎。,Miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.,"Miller has never been involved in literary criticism work, he clearly states that these people will not be welcomed in America during the Trump era."
这种关于雕像意义的冲突是更广泛的政治和文化战争的一部分：这实际上是与美国精神相冲突。,This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.,This kind of conflict regarding the meaning of statues is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is actually a clash with the American spirit.
拉扎鲁斯 (Lazarus) ，以及她的、在她去世后举行活动将她的诗句铭刻在基座上的朋友们，很清楚他们正在参与的行为具有高度政治性。,Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.,"Lazarus, as well as her friends who held an event to inscribe her verses on a base after her death, are well aware that their actions carry a high degree of political significance."
该雕塑的目的是通过作为自由女神的女性化身的、古老的经典比喻来表达法国和美国共和主义之间的联系。,"The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope, the female embodiment of Liberty.",The purpose of this sculpture is to express the connection between French and American republicanism through the feminized personification of the classical symbol of the goddess of liberty.
"拉撒路改变了这个意思：在她的诗中，女性形象不再抽象,她要发声。",Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.,"The translation of the Chinese text to English is:

The image of women has changed its meaning in her poetry: they are no longer abstract, she wants to speak out."
她给自己起了一个非常不同的名字：流放之母。,And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.,She gave herself an extremely unusual name: Banished Mother.
"这首诗与这幅画的结合是一场成功的女权主义政变,并且是对美国本土主义的毁灭性打击。",The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.,"This poem, in combination with this painting, represents a successful feminist coup, and at the same time, delivers a devastating blow to American nativism."
就像拉撒路改变雕像的意义一样，右翼者一直想要把它改回原意。,"And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.","Just like how the right-wingers want to change the meaning of the Statue of Liberty back to its original intent, in the same way."
