民权团体针对密苏里州发出旅行警告,Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri,Civil rights groups issue travel warnings for Missouri.
由于密苏里州的歧视性政策和种族主义袭击，美国有色人种促进协会 (NAACP) 向准备前往密苏里州出游的有色人群发出旅行警告。,The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.,"Due to the discriminatory policies and racial attacks in Missouri, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has issued a travel warning to people of color planning to visit Missouri."
“2017 年 8 月 28 日生效的 NAACP 密苏里州旅行咨询中呼吁，因近期密苏里州发生了一系列可疑的种族性事件，所有非裔美籍旅行者、游客以及密苏里州人在密苏里州旅行时应特别注意并采取极其谨慎的态度，特此告知，”该团体的声明宣称。,"""The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein,"" the group's statement reads.","""On August 28, 2017, the NAACP Missouri travel advisory came into effect, urging all African-American travelers, tourists, and Missouri residents to be extremely cautious and vigilant when traveling in Missouri due to a series of suspicious racial incidents that have recently occurred in the state. This is to inform you,"" the group's statement claims."
NAACP 指出，最近通过的一项密苏里州法律使得人们更难赢得歧视诉讼，该州执法也一定程度上针对少数群体，这些现象促使该组织发布了旅行警告。,"A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.","The NAACP points out that a recently passed Missouri state law makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, and the state's enforcement also targets minority groups to some extent, prompting the organization to issue a travel warning."

他们因肤色被停车盘问，被殴打或被杀害，”密苏里州 NAACP 主席罗德·查培尔告诉堪萨斯城星报 (The Kansas City Star)。,"They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed,"" the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.","""They were stopped, beaten or killed because of their skin color,"" Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star."
“我们收到了许多投诉，数量前所未有。”,"""We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before.""","""We have received many complaints, an unprecedented number."""
这是该组织在美国针对某个州发布的第一个此类警告。,It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.,This is the first such alert issued by the organization in the United States targeting a specific state.
该组织援引了密苏里大学对黑人学生的种族诽谤以及 28 岁田纳西州黑人男性托利·桑德斯的死亡事件。,"The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.",The organization cited the racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black man Torry Sallis in Tennessee.
今年早些时候，桑德斯在可疑情况下死亡。他在密苏里州旅行时燃油耗尽，被密苏里州警方在无指控犯罪的情况下拘留。,"Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.","Early this year, Sanders died under suspicious circumstances. He ran out of fuel while traveling in Missouri and was detained by Missouri police without any criminal charges."
咨询中还指出，密苏里州总检察长办公室最近的一份报告显示，“与白人相比，该州的黑人司机被停车盘查的可能性要高出 75%”。,The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.,"The text translates to:

""According to the consultation, a recent report from the Missouri State Attorney General's Office also pointed out that 'compared to white drivers, black drivers in the state are 75% more likely to be stopped and searched'."""
查培尔说：“该份咨询是为了提高人们的意识，警告他们的家人、朋友和同事在密苏里州可能发生的情况。”,"""The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri,"" Chapel said.","Chapell said, ""This consultation is to raise people's awareness, warning their families, friends, and colleagues about the situation that may occur in Missouri."""
“人们需要做好准备，无论是携带保释金前往密苏里州，还是让亲属知道自己在州内旅行”。,"""People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state.""","""Everyone needs to be prepared, whether it's carrying a bond to Missouri or letting family members know they are traveling within the state."""
根据联邦调查局仇恨犯罪报告计划的最新数据，密苏里州在 2015 年记录了 100 起仇恨罪行；根据罪行量，该州在全国排名第 16 位。,"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.","According to the latest data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; based on the volume of crimes, the state ranked 16th nationwide."
旅行警告也是对密苏里州新法律的回应，该法律将使起诉住房或就业歧视企业变得更加困难。,The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.,"The travel warning is also a response to the new law in Missouri, which will make it more difficult to sue companies for housing or employment discrimination."
此前，美国各州通过了移民执法法律，要求当地执法部门拘留移民违规人员，美国公民自由联盟 (ACLU) 表示此举会增加种族诉讼数量，并发布了针对德克萨斯州和亚利桑那州的旅行咨询。,"Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.","Before this, various states in the United States passed immigration enforcement laws, requiring local law enforcement agencies to detain immigrants who violate the rules. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) stated that this would increase the number of racial discrimination lawsuits and issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona."
旅行警告通常是由美国政府针对其他国家发布的，但最近，咨询团体采取这一方式以应对美国境内的某些法律和趋势。,"Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.","Travel warnings are usually issued by the U.S. government for other countries, but recently, advisory groups have taken this approach to address certain laws and trends within the United States."
经历2015年票房猛增的“黄金时代”后，2016年整体电影市场进入了冷静期，能否突破去年440.69亿元的总票房成绩都成为一个悬念。,"After experiencing the “golden era” of a soaring box office in 2015, the film market retreated into a cooling-off period in 2016. Whether box office takings could surpass last year’s total of RMB44.069 billion is questionable.","After experiencing the ""Golden Age"" of box office growth in 2015, the overall film market entered a calm period in 2016. Whether it can break through the total box office revenue of 44.069 billion yuan from the previous year has become a suspense."
从国家统计局公布的数据看，10月，北京新房和二手房价格双双降温，环比仅上涨0.6%和1.1%。,"Data from the National Bureau of Statistics revealed that in October, prices of new and second-hand residential properties cooled, up 0.6% and 1.1% month-on-month, respectively.","Based on the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, in October, both new and second-hand house prices in Beijing cooled down, with year-on-year increases of only 0.6% and 1.1%, respectively."
现任欧足联首席技术官的卢佩斯库在本次大会上做了一份关于2016年欧锦赛以及上赛季欧冠联赛的技术报告。,"Lupekscu, the current Chief Technology Officer of UEFA, made a technical report on the 2016 UEFA Euro and the last season of European Champions League at the meeting.","The current UEFA Chief Technical Officer, Lupeșcu, presented a technical report on the 2016 European Championship and the previous season's Champions League at this conference."

综合上述数据可知，在全球受统计的246个国家中，共有99个国家（或占比40%）对比特币的交易和使用不施加限制，即绿色和橘黄色的地区。,"From the above data, it can be seen that of the 246 countries that have been rated, a total of 99 countries (or 40% of the total) haven't imposed any restrictions on the transactions and use of Bitcoin. They are represented by green and orange patches.","Based on the data mentioned above, it can be seen that among the 246 countries surveyed globally, there are 99 countries (or 40%) that do not impose restrictions on the trading and use of Bitcoin, which are the green and orange regions."
有7个国家（或占比3%）是受限市场（淡粉色），有10个国家（或占比4%）定义比特币为非法（深粉色），有130个国家（或占比53%）还没有更多的对待数字货币信息（灰色）。,"Seven countries (or 3%) are restricted markets (pale pink), 10 countries (or 4%) have defined Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53) %) haven't given comments on digital currency (grey).","There are 7 countries (or 3%) that are restricted markets (light pink), 10 countries (or 4%) that define Bitcoin as illegal (deep pink), and 130 countries (or 53%) that do not have more information on how to treat digital currencies (gray)."
这说明，占全球主体（53%，超过半数）的国家仍在观望以比特币为首的数字货币在境内的合法性，也代表了比特币的“黑天鹅风险”依旧很大，因为其中一部分国家最终可能会作出限制数字货币的立法决定。,"This shows that countries that account for the global majority (53%, more than half) are still indecisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies represented by Bitcoin. This means that the “black swan risk” is still very large for Bitcoin, because some of these countries may ultimately make legislation that restrict the use of digital currencies.","This shows that the majority of countries (53%, more than half) in the world are still observing the legality of digital currencies led by Bitcoin within their borders, and it also represents that the ""black swan risk"" of Bitcoin is still very high, because some of these countries may eventually make legislative decisions to restrict digital currencies."
文章认为，全球监管机构对数字货币这个新兴类别还没有完全理解，可能是大部分国家还没有作出表态的主要原因。,The article believes that global regulators have not fully understood the digital currency as a new type of currency. This may be the main reason why most countries have not chosen a stance.,"The article believes that global regulatory bodies have not fully understood the new category of digital currencies, which may be the main reason why most countries have not made a stance yet."
尽管比特币的“人气”自去年以来呈指数级增长，并不代表所有国家都感兴趣，可能有些国家担心当地法币因此受到威胁，或更担心数字货币被犯罪组织利用。,"Although Bitcoin’s popularity has grown exponentially since last year, it does not necessarily mean that all countries are interested in it. It's probably that some countries are concerned that the local currency may be undermined by digital currencies or that digital currencies are used by criminal organizations.","Despite the ""popularity"" of Bitcoin growing exponentially since last year, it does not mean that all countries are interested. Some countries may be worried that their local fiat currency will be threatened, or even more worried that digital currencies will be exploited by criminal organizations."
华尔街见闻曾撰文详细总结了上周以来针对比特币的国际监管新闻，包括中国开始打击场外类交易所的集中服务在线平台和移动App、韩国仍在考虑关闭数字货币交易所、欧盟认为比特币还没有被广泛接受并警告投资者“赔到血本无归”的风险等。,"Wallstreetcn has published an article summarizing the news related to regulation measures against Bitcoin across the world since last week, including: China starts to crackdown on online platforms and mobile APPs of over-the-counter exchanges; South Korea is still considering to close the digital currency exchanges; the European Union holds the view that Bitcoin has not yet been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of “losing everything”.","Wall Street Journal has written a detailed summary of the international regulatory news on Bitcoin over the past week, including China's crackdown on centralized service platforms and mobile apps for over-the-counter exchanges, South Korea's consideration of closing digital currency exchanges, and the European Union's view that Bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warning investors of the risk of ""losing everything"" in their investments."
华尔街见闻主编精选《读要闻|2018：全球央妈开启数字货币元年？》曾提到，从监管、接受/批判、采纳的任一角度来看，2018年都将成为全球央行的数字货币元年。,"Wallstreetcn Editor's selection: Reading News | 2018: Global Central Banks Are Ushering Digital Currency?

It mentioned that from any perspective, whether it's regulation, acceptance/criticism, or adoption, 2018 will be the year of digital currency for global central banks."
俄罗斯等大国批评比特币合法性地位的做法，其实也是为了给官方发行数字货币让路。,The act of questioning the legal status of Bitcoin by big countries such as Russia is actually meant to make way for the official issuance of digital currencies.,"Major countries like Russia criticize the legal status of Bitcoin, which is actually also to pave the way for the official issuance of digital currencies."
新华社马德里1月8日电（报道员谢宇智）巴塞罗那新援库蒂尼奥8日在诺坎普首次身披巴萨球衣亮相。,"On January 8th, the Barcelona new aid Philippe Coutinho showed up for the first time in Camp Nou with his Barcelona shirt, the Xinhua News Agency reported in Madrid by reporter Xie Yuzhi.","Xinhua News Agency, Madrid, January 8th (Reporter Xie Yuzhi) Barcelona's new signing Coutinho made his first appearance in a Barcelona jersey at the Nou Camp on the 8th."
库蒂尼奥当日上午通过了巴萨的体检，并与巴萨主席巴托梅乌在一份将于2023年夏天到期的合同上签了字。,Coutinho passed a physical examination of Barcelona early that morning and signed with Barcelona president Bartomeu a contract that will expire in the summer of 2023.,Coutinho passed Barcelona's medical examination that morning and signed a contract with Barcelona President Bartomeu that will expire in the summer of 2023.
随后他作为巴萨球员，在诺坎普近7000名球迷面前亮相。,"Then he appeared in the face of nearly 7,000 Camp Nou fans as a Barcelona player.","Then he appeared as a Barcelona player in front of nearly 7,000 fans at the Nou Camp."
据西班牙媒体透露，库蒂尼奥的转会费总额或达到1.6亿欧元（1欧元约合7.77元人民币），是巴萨俱乐部及西甲历史第一身价。,"According to a Spanish media, Coutinho's transfer fee may amount to 160 million euros (1 euro≈ 1.77 Chinese yuan), being the highest paid player in the history of Barcelona and La Liga.","According to Spanish media revelations, Coutinho's total transfer fee may reach 160 million euros (approximately 1,234.8 million CNY), making it the highest transfer fee in Barcelona and La Liga history."
由于眼下库蒂尼奥仍有伤在身，他还需休整近20日才能迎来自己身披巴萨球衣的处子秀。,"As Coutinho is still injured at the moment, he still need recuperate for nearly 20 days before ushering in his debut in the Barcelona shirt.","Due to the injury, Coutinho still needs to rest for nearly 20 days before he can make his debut in the Barcelona jersey."
还有什么神圣的东西？,Is nothing sacred?,Is there anything else sacred?
现在特朗普的白宫正在瞄准自由女神像,Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty,The current Trump White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
政权更迭最确定的标志是他们开始攻击雕像之时。,The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.,The most definitive sign of a regime change is when they start attacking statues.
美国人和任何人一样都赞同这一点。 因此，2003 年巴格达天堂广场的萨达姆?侯赛因被精心策划地推倒了。,Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.,"The translation of the given Chinese text to English is:

""Americans and anyone else agree on this point. Therefore, the carefully planned toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad's Paradise Square in 2003 was a significant event."""
"斯蒂芬?米勒 (Stephen Miller) 作为特朗普政府的关键智囊之一，在与美国有线电视新闻网 (CNN) 的吉姆?阿科斯塔 (Jim Acosta) 就总统关于严格限制合法移民的提议进行激烈争论时,他肯定知道自己对自由女神像砍出象征性的一斧会发生什么事情。","Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.","Stephen Miller, as one of the key strategists of the Trump administration, knew exactly what would happen when he took a symbolic swing at the Statue of Liberty during a heated debate with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposal to severely limit legal immigration."
公平地说，米勒并没有攻击雕像本身。,"In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.","To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue itself."
如果他这样做了，那么一群游船业主和自由主义的追随者一定会将他生吞活剥。,A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.,"If he does that, then a group of boat owners and liberal followers will definitely tear him apart."
但是他确实攻击了塑像的意义，尤其是在 1903 年埃玛?拉撒路的着名诗歌被刻在基座上时（这座纪念碑在此后17年方建成）而具有的意义。,"But he did attack its meaning, and in particular the meaning ascribed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed.","However, he did indeed attack the meaning of the statue, especially when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was engraved on the base in 1903 (the monument was not completed for another 17 years), and the meaning it possessed at that time."
正如米勒斥责阿科斯塔所说：“我不想在这里谈论历史的全部事实，但自由女神像是美国自由照亮世界的象征......。,"As Miller scolded Acosta: ""I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.","As Miller scolded Acosta, saying, ""I don't want to discuss all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is like a symbol of American freedom illuminating the world..."""
你所指的那首诗，那是后来又加上去的，不是原始自由女神像的一部分。”,"The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.""","The poem you mentioned, that was added later, it's not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
事实上，米勒是正确的，但是正如他自己所说的，这不是真正关于历史。,"Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history.","In fact, Miller is right, but as he himself said, this is not truly about history."
这涉及到拉撒路惊世之语的现代回音，唯一一个国家似乎不仅邀请任何老移民，而且还邀请穷人中最贫穷的人：“你的疲惫、你的穷困、或者你的挤作一团的民众渴望自由呼吸，/苦难的人拒绝你拥挤的海滩。”,"It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: ""Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.""","This involves the modern echo of Lazarus' shocking words, with one country seemingly not only inviting any old immigrant but also inviting the poorest of the poor: ""Your fatigue, your poverty, or your crowded masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."""
不存在“苦难的人拒绝”在我们的屏幕变得更刺眼的一刻。,"There has never been a time when the ""wretched refuse"" has been more visible on our screens.","""There is no 'suffering person refuses' moment when our screens become more piercing."""
米勒并没有从事过文学评论工作，他清楚地表明，这些人在特朗普时代的美国不会受到欢迎。,Miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.,"Miller has never engaged in literary criticism, and he clearly indicates that these people would not be welcome in Trump's America."
这种关于雕像意义的冲突是更广泛的政治和文化战争的一部分：这实际上是与美国精神相冲突。,This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.,This conflict over the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict with the American spirit.
拉扎鲁斯 (Lazarus) ，以及她的、在她去世后举行活动将她的诗句铭刻在基座上的朋友们，很清楚他们正在参与的行为具有高度政治性。,Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.,"Lazarus, as well as her friends who held activities after her death and engraved her poetry on the base, were very clear that the behavior they were participating in was highly political."
该雕塑的目的是通过作为自由女神的女性化身的、古老的经典比喻来表达法国和美国共和主义之间的联系。,"The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope, the female embodiment of Liberty.","The purpose of this sculpture is to express the connection between French and American Republicanism through the female embodiment of the Statue of Liberty, an ancient classic metaphor."
"拉撒路改变了这个意思：在她的诗中，女性形象不再抽象,她要发声。",Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.,"Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poetry, the female image is no longer abstract, she wants to speak out."
她给自己起了一个非常不同的名字：流放之母。,And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.,She gave herself a very different name: The Mother of Exile.
"这首诗与这幅画的结合是一场成功的女权主义政变,并且是对美国本土主义的毁灭性打击。",The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.,The combination of this poem and this painting is a successful feminist revolution and a devastating blow to American nativism.
就像拉撒路改变雕像的意义一样，右翼者一直想要把它改回原意。,"And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.","Just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wingers have always wanted to restore its original meaning."
