“我们收到了许多投诉，数量前所未有。”,"""We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before.""","Translate the following text from zh to en: “我们收到了许多投诉，数量前所未有。”
The translation of ""We received many complaints, more than ever before."" is correct. The original text in Chinese says:

“我们收到了许多投诉，数量前所未有。”

Breaking it down:
- 我们 (wǒmen) = We
- 收到了 (shōudiǎo le) = received
- 许多 (xǔduō) = many
- 投诉 (tóupù) = complaints
- 数量 (shùliàng) = quantity/number
- 始来前所未有 (shǐlái wúgèhán) = never before

Therefore, a direct and accurate translation would be ""We received many complaints, more than ever before."" 

This sentence implies that the number of complaints was significantly higher than what they had experienced in the past. The phrase ""前所未有的"" (wúgèhán) indicates an unprecedented or record-high level. 

So, the English version accurately conveys the meaning of the original Chinese statement."
