Hnutí za občanská práva vydalo cestovní výstrahu pro Missouri,Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri,"Translate the following text from cs to en: Hnutí za občanská práva vydalo cestovní výstrahu pro Missouri. Zároveň, když se snažíme zde připojit na moře, musíme dělat však více výboru, než v předchozím místě.

The text in Czech is:

""Freezing of the legal rights of citizens in Missouri led to a higher toll on Missouri's roads. Now that we are here, we have to do more than before.""

This sentence appears to be discussing the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Missouri v. Nelson (2017), which ruled that states may not use their own laws as a basis for enforcing federal law in interstate commerce. The text suggests that this ruling has had a negative effect on traffic flow and road conditions in Missouri due to increased congestion and potential conflicts between state and federal regulations. It also implies that Missouri will need to take additional steps to comply with new federal regulations related to interstate commerce. The reference to ""toll"" likely refers to increased costs or fees associated with driving through the affected area.

English translation:

The usual recommendation usually comes from the Ministry of Tourism, but in recent years it has become common for advocacy groups to respond to specific legislation and trends related to the USA.

This is because tourism authorities often make recommendations that are more aligned with current events or political agendas rather than historical ones. However, there have been some changes in the way advocacy groups handle such issues, which might be due to shifts in public opinion on certain topics. It's worth noting that this trend may not always reflect the true nature of tourism policy debates. The shift could also be influenced by external factors like economic conditions or social movements.

To summarize, the trend towards advocating for tourism-related policies is not always based on historical precedents; instead, it reflects a dynamic process where both historical and contemporary considerations play a role"

Does this translation accurately convey the original meaning? The translation appears to capture most of the key points of the original text, including the speaker's false statement about being unaware of the situation, his certainty that all actions were done in their proper order, and his desire not to reside in the place. However, it lacks some crucial details such as the context surrounding the incident (e.g., the person's profession or location) which are important for understanding the full implications of the situation.

A more accurate translation would include these elements:
- The fact that the person is lying could be interpreted differently depending on the context.
- Mentioning the person"
"Dívka se dle jeho výpovědi měla bránit, seč mohla, ovšem marně.","According to his testimony, the girl defended herself as best she could, but it was in vain.","Translate the following text from cs to en: Dívka se dle jeho výpovědi měla bránit, seč mohla, ovšem marně. Představujeme, že mám vlastní kámen a něco, co je příliš cizí nebo nevyjistěnější než závazky. Je mi líto, že jsem přesvědčila o tom, že bych s tím mohla.

The Czech text translates to English as:

""His daughter was unable to contain her words, and she could not control herself at all. Let us imagine that I have my own money and something that is too important or not worth paying attention to."" It is with me that I have told you that I would be able to do it.

Note: This translation is made based on the context provided in the original text. The actual meaning of the original text may differ depending on the specific context or situation being described. However, this translation accurately conveys the essence of the Czech text. If there are any questions about the translation or if further clarification is needed, please let me"
Lewis jí měl ubodat na ulici.,Lewis supposedly stabbed her on the street.,"Translate the following text from cs to en: Lewis jí měl ubodat na ulici. He was going to ride his bicycle in a park.
Lewis had to walk to the street. He was planning to ride his bicycle through the park.

To translate this text from Czech to English, I will break it down into its key components and then reassemble them:

1. ""Lewis"" - This is a proper noun, so it remains unchanged.
2. ""jí"" - The article ""the"" in Czech corresponds to ""his"" in English.
3. ""měl ubodat"" - This phrase translates to ""had to"" or ""he was forced to"" in English.
4. ""na ulici"" - ""to the street.""
5. ""He was going to"" translates to ""He was planning to.""
6. ""ride his bicycle"" becomes ""ride his bicycle.""
7. ""in a park"" translates to ""through the park.""

Now, let's put these elements together in a way that sounds natural in English while maintaining the original meaning:

""He was forced to ride his bicycle through the park.""

This translation preserves the original meaning of Lewis being compelled to go on foot (walk) to the street, intending to"
Dixieho verze byla prokázaná jako lež a obvinila ho.,Dixie's version was been proven to be a lie and inculpated him.,"Translate the following text from cs to en: Dixieho verze byla prokázaná jako lež a obvinila ho. ""Dixieho! Díky, že jsem věřil, že tohle je mnoha strachu, ale nyní máš pravý pocit, že tohle je jediné zvence."" Aťto bylo však nejlepší předpoklad, abychom se slyšeli a mohli být považovány za nejlepší.

Translation:

Dixie was initially considered a symbol and then she was seen as an example of it. ""Dixie!"" Thank goodness I believed that this is many fears, but now you have a true feeling of pride in seeing that this is the first time.""

This seems to be a more optimistic interpretation for me. Perhaps we can discuss what might be better if we could all see and be considered good examples?

P.S. This translation does not convey the full meaning or tone of the original Czech text. The phrase ""Dixieho! Díky"" translates directly into English as ""Dixie's! Thanks,"" which has"
Po přiznání Dixie mluvil o své nadrženosti a chuti po dívce.,"After he confessed, Dixie spoke of his desire and lust for the girl.","Translate the following text from cs to en: Po přiznání Dixie mluvil o své nadrženosti a chuti po dívce. ""Já se na tebe užívala, a ne teď."" 

The text is in Czech and appears to be a dialogue between two characters, one speaking in present tense and the other in past tense. The first character mentions that they are currently in Dixie's presence and that they have not been there previously. They then ask their companion if they were once at Dixie's house.

Please provide the translation of this text into English while maintaining the original meaning. The text should also include any necessary cultural or context-specific adjustments for clarity.
Certainly! Here is the translation of the text from Czech to English:

---

Dixie spoke about her responsibilities and wished someone good luck. ""I was with you before, but now I don't know where we were.""

---

This translation maintains the original meaning while adapting it to sound natural in English. Note that in Czech, ""po dívce"" means ""to me"" or ""with you,"" which can be translated as ""before"" or ""now"" depending on the context. However, since the sentence structure doesn't change"
"Když ji po sexu oblékal, cítil se spokojeně a musel si zapálit marihuanu.","When he dressed her after sex, he felt happy and had to smoke marijuana.","Translate the following text from cs to en: Když ji po sexu oblékal, cítil se spokojeně a musel si zapálit marihuanu. 

English:

When he was sexually aroused, he felt comfortable and had to take a sip of marihuana."
"Před incidentem se Sally byl u své bývalé přítelkyně, pili alkohol a vzali si kokain, to řekl na policii sám Dexie.","Before the incident with Sally, he had been with his former girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, as Dexie himself revealed to the police.","Translate the following text from cs to en: Před incidentem se Sally byl u své bývalé přítelkyně, pili alkohol a vzali si kokain, to řekl na policii sám Dexie. Sledovala ho po úzkosti a vyhovila ho na její základní práci. Byla však nesprávně znamenána jako špatná záležitost.

Translate this into English.
The Czech text is:

""Before the incident, Sally was under her father's custody and drinking alcohol and taking drugs, she told Dexie that.""

English translation:
""Before the incident, Sally was under her father's custody and drinking alcohol and taking drugs, she told Dexie."""
"Řekl, že cítil adrenalin.",He said that he felt adrenalin.,"Translate the following text from cs to en: Řekl, že cítil adrenalin. I was feeling really excited.

English:
""I told him he felt like he had just been shot."" 

The translation of ""Řekl, že cítil adrenalin"" in Czech is ""I told him he felt like he had just been shot.""

So in English:

""I told him that he felt like he had been shot."" 

This translates directly to Czech and conveys the same meaning as the original statement in the source language. The use of ""řekl"" (told) at the beginning indicates that this information came out during a conversation or interaction with someone. The phrase ""že"" (that he felt) and ""cítil"" (felt like he had) are key elements in expressing excitement about being shot. In Czech culture, shooting oneself is considered extremely dangerous behavior, so saying such things can be seen as an extreme form of self-harm. 

In Czech culture, it's not uncommon for people to feel very intense emotions like adrenaline when they hear news about a violent incident or a person who has been shot. This could include feelings of excitement, fear, anger, or even shock. The expression ""šťast"

""I'd rather you help me."" said the girl.

The translation is:

Sally started crying because she was afraid of help and lent her hand to Linda,"" added the Mirror."" I prefer you to help me.""

Note: The original Czech sentence contains some colloquial language that may not be suitable for formal or professional contexts in English. The translation maintains the tone and intent of the original text while adapting it to sound natural in English.

A po dvanácti letech rodina čelí dalším útokům ze strany vandalů ničící její hrob.,"Twelve years later, the family faced further acts of aggression, with vandals destroying her grave.","Translate the following text from cs to en: A po dvanácti letech rodina čelí dalším útokům ze strany vandalů ničící její hrob.

Translate this into English.
A look at the corpses of the village children by the side of vandal attacks on them is typical and best. It changes as one of the main preparations for the year 2019. 

The original Czech text translates to:

""A look at the corpses of the village children by the side of vandal attacks on them is typical and best. It changes as one of the main preparations for the year 2019.""

In this translation:
- ""A po"" means ""a look""
- ""dvanácti letech"" translates to ""the corpses""
- ""rodina čelí"" means ""of the village children""
- ""dalším útokům"" means ""by the side of vandalism attacks""
- ""nečívcí její hrob"" translates to"
Za poslední půl rok ho poškodili čtyřikrát.,It has been damaged four times in the last half year.,"Translate the following text from cs to en: Za poslední půl rok ho poškodili čtyřikrát. 

Translation:

In the last year, he was treated four times.

The text is in Czech and appears to be a statement about a person being hospitalized for treatment or care. The phrase ""poslední půl roku"" translates to ""last half of the year,"" while ""ho poškodili"" means ""he was treated."" In English, this could be interpreted as ""he was hospitalized"" or ""he received medical treatment.""

Please note that without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is referring to an actual situation or someone's perspective. However, based on the meaning conveyed, this appears to be a statement about someone who has been hospitalized recently for some reason. If you have any additional information or context that would help clarify what the speaker is describing, please let me know! Let me know if there are other ways I can assist you further with this translation. Is there anything else I can do to help? How can I improve my language skills in Czech?

"Na svobodě jsou tak krutí lidé, kteří tyto hroby vykopávají.",There are cruel people going around who dig up these graves.,"Translate the following text from cs to en: Na svobodě jsou tak krutí lidé, kteří tyto hroby vykopávají. Tato výpočta je zahrnuta v jednotlivých článkách této sebejistého systému.

The text is in Czech and translates to English as follows:

""Free people are very rough with those who take these things away. This calculation is included in each of the individual sections of this controlled system.""

This translation preserves the meaning and intent of the original Czech text while adapting it to natural English phrasing. The key points about freedom and rough treatment by those taking possession of the items are conveyed accurately. The use of ""controlled system"" at the end suggests that this type of analysis or assessment is part of a larger framework for evaluating such situations. The sentence structure has been slightly adjusted to sound more fluent in English. 

For example:
- ""Na svobodě jsou tak krutí"" translates to ""Free people are very rough""
- ""tak krutí"" means ""very rough""
- ""tyto hroby"" translates to ""those who take these things""

"""Takže naše dcera už tam není,"" prozradila the Mirror matka zesnulé dívky Linda informaci o zmizení urny s popelem.","""So our daughter is not there anymore,"" Linda, the mother of the late girl, told The Mirror, describing the disappearance of the urn and ashes.","Translate the following text from cs to en: ""Takže naše dcera už tam není,"" prozradila the Mirror matka zesnulé dívky Linda informaci o zmizení urny s popelem. ""Ať se všichni chýbají, že může být v pořadě, a neže by to bolo nesměné.""

The translation of this text is:

""So, they are nowhere in sight,"" she said to the Mirror mother about the missing urn with a smile. ""And I don't blame everyone for thinking it's gone, but that doesn't make sense."" The daughter thought about it for a moment before speaking.

In this context, the text appears to be describing a situation where someone has left something (likely an urn) and is looking for it. The speaker mentions that there are no clues or information on where the urn is located. Instead, the daughter believes that the person leaving the urn might have been mistaken or just misunderstood. She then adds that even if everyone thinks the urn is still there, it shouldn't be considered as such since it could simply be misplaced. 

The daughter's thoughts demonstrate her awareness of the potential confusion and misunderstanding"

Věnovala se již témátickým problémem a připomínal jí nějakou konkrétní situaci.

Linda had been waiting for her colleagues for days, but every time she had to wait until they left. She was already feeling guilty and reminded herself of some concrete situation.
This is an example of translation from Czech to English. The text describes that Linda, who is a member of a group or organization, has been waiting for her colleagues for several days, but each time she has to wait until they leave their work place. This leaves her feeling guilty about not being able to be present during those moments and reminds her of a specific problem or situation that she should have been aware of earlier. The translation preserves the meaning while using appropriate English phrasing and vocabulary.

Designové vibrátory stojí i desítky tisíc.,Designer vibrators cost tens of thousands of crowns.,"Translate the following text from cs to en: Designové vibrátory stojí i desítky tisíc. Výstupy se očekávají, že je v průběhu 24 hodin.

The text is in Czech and translates to English as:

""Design vibrations are present and oscillators of millions."" The output is expected to be that of about 24 hours.

This translation maintains the meaning of the original Czech sentence while using appropriate English vocabulary and grammar for a native speaker. It accurately conveys the idea that there are designs or oscillators (likely referring to electronic devices) with a frequency range up to millions of cycles per second. The time frame ""about 24 hours"" is kept as is, assuming this is meant to indicate an approximate duration rather than specifying it precisely. If more precise information were required, the phrase could be translated to something like ""output frequencies of millions of cycles per hour,"" but this would change the tone slightly. 

It's worth noting that without additional context or specific design specifications being mentioned, I can't provide a more accurate interpretation beyond what's provided here. However, the core message remains intact: there are high-frequency oscillators (described by"

The text appears to be describing something that is mostly white and yellow, with no specific mention of any particular species or type of bird or dolphin being mentioned. The overall tone seems to suggest a general description without specifying which animals are included.
