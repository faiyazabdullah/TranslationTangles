This statement reflects the view of economists who believe that during economic downturns, government intervention through fiscal policies (such as increased spending and tax cuts) can help stimulate demand and prevent further下滑of employment rates. The idea behind this approach is that by injecting more money into the economy through these measures, businesses have more purchasing power, which can lead to increased production and hiring. However, critics argue that relying solely on government stimulus without addressing underlying structural issues or providing support for those who are most vulnerable during recessions may not be sustainable over time.

This sentence refers to a comparison between the natural increase in population (births minus deaths) for two countries, which can be used to assess their demographic trends. The statement suggests that over time, the number of people living in Saudi Arabia is increasing faster than it is in Bangladesh. This could indicate various factors such as higher fertility rates, better healthcare services, or other socioeconomic changes in Saudi Arabia compared to its neighbor, Bangladesh. However, without additional context, we cannot determine if these are positive or negative developments for either country. It's important to consider both sides of the equation when comparing population growth rates across different regions and nations. 

For more accurate information on the current status of Saudi Arabia's population growth rate relative to Bangladesh, you might want to consult recent data sources or official statistics from reliable organizations like the United Nations Population Division or national statistical offices of both countries. These resources provide up-to-date figures based on comprehensive surveys and projections.
