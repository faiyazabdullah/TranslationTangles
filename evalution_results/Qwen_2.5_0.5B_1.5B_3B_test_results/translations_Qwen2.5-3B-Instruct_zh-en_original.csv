该组织援引了密苏里大学对黑人学生的种族诽谤以及 28 岁田纳西州黑人男性托利·桑德斯的死亡事件。,"The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.","Translate the following text from zh to en: 该组织援引了密苏里大学对黑人学生的种族诽谤以及 28 岁田纳西州黑人男性托利·桑德斯的死亡事件。 在这些事件中，白人至上主义者和极端分子在社交媒体上煽动了暴力，并且他们的言论和行为导致了针对黑人的仇恨犯罪。
The group cited the racial slanders against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tennessee’s black male, Tully Sanders, at age 28. In these incidents, white supremacists and extremists incited violence on social media, and their words and actions led to hate crimes against blacks.

Now, I will provide a more detailed version for better understanding:

The organization highlighted two significant events involving racial defamation and violent acts. First, they pointed out the racial slurs directed at black students at the University of Missouri. Second, they addressed the tragic death of a 28-year-old black man named Tully Sanders in Tennessee.

He ran out of fuel while traveling in Missouri and was arrested by Missouri police without charges being filed against him. He claimed to be an American citizen and requested a meeting with the Attorney General. The police refused this request, stating that there was not enough evidence to support his claims.

- ""他在密苏里州旅行时燃油耗尽"" translates to ""He ran out of fuel while traveling in Missouri""

The travel warning is also a response to a new law in Missouri that makes it harder to sue businesses for housing or employment discrimination. The new law went into effect in October of last year, while Missouri had already experienced at least four lawsuits involving racial discrimination prior to that. US Attorney General Holder called the Missouri law ""a mistake"" and referred to it as a ""racial discrimination law."" He urged Governor Jay Nixon to immediately repeal the law, saying it could prevent future similar incidents from occurring. Warning: The new law in Missouri may lead to more racial discrimination lawsuits"
