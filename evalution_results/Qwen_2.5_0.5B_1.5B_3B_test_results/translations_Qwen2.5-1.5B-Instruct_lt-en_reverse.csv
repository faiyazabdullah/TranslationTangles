Why are Hong Kong domestic workers practising their dance moves?,Kodėl Honkongo namų darbininkai mokosi šokio judesių?,"Translate the following text from en to lt: Why are Hong Kong domestic workers practising their dance moves? The reason is that they have been deprived of a living wage and basic rights.
Why are Hong Kong domestic workers practicing their dance moves? The reason is that they have been deprived of a living wage and basic rights. This is not just a problem for Hong Kong, but also a global issue affecting millions of people around the world.

In recent years, there has been increasing concern about the working conditions of migrant workers in many countries, including China, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. These countries rely heavily on migrant labor to support their economies, but often fail to provide adequate wages or social protections for these workers. As a result, migrant workers are forced to work long hours and under harsh conditions, which can lead to physical and mental health problems.

The situation in Hong Kong is particularly concerning because it is home to some of the most skilled and educated workers in the world. Many of them come from different parts of Asia and work in high-skilled jobs such as engineering, finance, and technology. However, despite their qualifications and skills, many of them struggle to find decent work and fair pay.

This situation is known as ""cohabitation"" or ""live-in relationship"". In this case, both parties have agreed to cohabit, but neither party wants to be legally recognized as a couple, so it's considered an informal arrangement.
The most common form of cohabitation is when one partner has children with another person, who then moves into the house where those children are living. This can lead to complicated legal situations if there are no agreements about property division, custody, etc., between the two partners.
To avoid these problems, couples often seek legal advice before starting cohabitation arrangements. They may also agree on certain terms beforehand, such as how long they plan to live together, what happens if one partner dies, and other details like this.
In summary, cohabitation involves two people agreeing to live together informally without being legally recognized as a couple. While this arrangement allows for flexibility and comfort, it can sometimes lead to complications due to lack of formal agreement.

The idea behind this project is simple: to create something new using recycled materials. We have selected different types of old furniture and are now working on creating new pieces out of them. Our goal is to make people think about what they can do with their old furniture and whether they could use them again or recycle them instead of throwing them away. We believe that recycling these items would be good for both the environment and our society. In addition, we want to promote the reuse of old furniture as well as encouraging others to take part in similar projects. By doing so, we hope to raise awareness about sustainable practices and inspire individuals to adopt environmentally friendly habits.
