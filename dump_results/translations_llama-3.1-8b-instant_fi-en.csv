Tutkittavan todellisuuden­taju näyttäytyy alttiina horjumiselle.,The patient's sense of reality is reported to be close to shaking.,The awareness of the investigated reality appears susceptible to being undermined.

Auer ei tunnistanut itseään näistä kuvauksista.,Auer does not recognise herself from these reports.,Auer did not recognize himself in these descriptions.
"""Oli järkytys kuulla, että minut diagnosoitiin mielisairaaksi"", Auer sanoo.","""It was shocking to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill"", Auer says.","""There was shock to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill,"" Auer says."
"Vielä suurempi järkytys oli, kun Auerille ei myönnetty sukupuolenkorjaushoitoa.",What was even more shocking was that Auer was not given access to gender reassignment surgery.,A more significant shock was when Auer was not granted sex reassignment surgery.
Hoitohenkilökunnan mukaan hänen voimavaransa eivät olleet riittävät prosessin aloittamiseen.,"According to the nursing staff, she did not have sufficient resources to start the process.","According to the nursing staff, his energy reserves were not sufficient to initiate the process."
Häneltä kiellettiin oma identiteettinsä.,Her own identity was denied from her.,"He was forbidden from his own identity.

(Note: This translation is quite literal and direct. The original sentence is quite powerful and poignant, conveying a sense of loss and erasure of one's self. A more idiomatic translation might be: ""He was denied his own identity"" or ""He was forced to hide his own identity"", depending on the context.)"
Silloin 11. helmikuuta 2015 ­Auer käveli ulos tapaamisesta ja potkaisi transpolin odotusaulan television hajalle.,"On that day on 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and smashed a TV in the waiting room of the transgender department.","At that time on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the waiting area of the tram stop into pieces with a television."

But, to have breasts removed altogether, a diagnosis is needed"", Auer says.","""It's absurd that anyone who is born as a woman can enlarge their breasts, but to remove them, a diagnosis is required,"" Auer says.

Note: The word ""hullua"" is often translated to English as ""absurd"" or ""ridiculous"", but in this context, it's more like ""absurd"" or ""illogical""."

Auerin kokemus ei valitettavasti ole ainoa laatuaan.,"Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not unique.","Auer's experience unfortunately is not the only one of its kind.

Note: The translation is quite literal, but the original text has a poetic tone that might be lost in translation. The word ""läpikäyvät"" can be translated to ""pass through"" or ""go through"", but it also implies a sense of movement or transition, which is not fully captured in the English translation."
"""On hullua, että ihmisiltä jotka ovat tuen ja avun tarpeessa evätään hoito vedoten siihen, etteivät heidän voimavaransa riitä"", Auer sanoo.","""It's crazy that treatment is denied from people who need help and support by saying that they don't have sufficient resources"", Auer says.","""It's absurd that people who need support and help are denied care because it's claimed that their resources aren't sufficient,"" Auer says."

Note: The translation is quite direct, but it's worth noting that the original text has a somewhat more nuanced tone, implying that these symptoms are a result of the process, rather than just a coincidence."
"Näihin vedoten hoitohenkilökunta voi määrätä, ettei hoitoa voida aloittaa.","By appealing to these, the nursing staff can decide that the process cannot be started.","Citing these reasons, the healthcare staff may decide that treatment cannot be started.

Why a broad chest didn't feel like it fit my body and why the pectoral muscles had to be round instead of being flat for a flat chest."
"Tärkeintä Auerille on ollut se, että hänen lähellään on ihmisiä, jotka näkevät hänet.",Auer has always found it important that she has people who can truly see her close to her.,The most important thing for Auer is that there are people around him who see him.

"Nykyään Auer kokee jo tulevansa nähdyksi, hän on olemassa naisena.","Currently, Auer feels that she is seen, and exists as a woman.","Now Auer feels like she is being seen, she exists as a woman.

Note: The translation is quite literal, as the original text is quite poetic and simple. The phrase ""nähdyksi"" can be translated to ""being seen"" or ""being recognized"", and ""olemassa"" can be translated to ""existing"" or ""being"". The phrase ""naisena"" means ""as a woman""."
Prosessin alkuvaiheessa läheisten sattumanvaraiset kommentit saattoivat kuitenkin satuttaa paljon.,"However, in the first phases of the process, random comments by people close to her hurt.","In the early stages of the process, however, casual comments from those close by could have been quite hurtful."
"Eniten satuttaa se, kun läheiset väärinsukupuolittavat.",What hurts me the most is when people close to me define my gender incorrectly.,The most hurtful thing is when those close to you betray you.

"Se ei ole ollut taiteilijalle terapiakokemus, vaan näyttely on poliittinen ja taiteellinen teoskokoelma.",The exhibition has not been any therapeutic experience for the artist; it is a political and artistic collection.,"Translation: 

It has not been an experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.

Note: This translation is quite literal, but if you want a more idiomatic translation, it could be:

It's not a therapeutic experience for the artist, but rather a political and artistic statement."
"Haluan uskoa, että taiteella on yhä painoarvoa ja että sen avulla voidaan saada aikaan poliittisia muutoksia, aikana jolloin poliitikot ovat unohtaneet ihmisoikeudet.","""I want to believe that art still matters and it helps to achieve political changes, during a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.""","I want to believe that art still has value and that it can bring about political changes, in a time when politicians have forgotten human rights."

Missourissa hiljattain voimaan tullut laki vaikeuttaa syrjintätapausten vientiä oikeuteen. Lisäksi osavaltion lakien täytäntöönpano kohdistuu suhteettomasti vähemmistöihin.

"”Matkustustiedotteen tarkoituksena on kehottaa ihmisiä olemaan varuillaan ja varoittamaan perheitään, ystäviään ja työtovereitaan siitä, mitä Missourissa voi tapahtua”, Chapel sanoo.","""The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri,"" Chapel said.","""The purpose of the travel advisory is to warn people to be cautious and to advise their families, friends, and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri,"" Chapel says."
